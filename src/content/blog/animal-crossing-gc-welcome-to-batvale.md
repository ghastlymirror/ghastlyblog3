I´m a bit of Animal Crossing veteran, this series will always remain one my favorites when it comes to life sims.

I´ve played Wild World (played it on a emulator since I couldn´t get a ds as a teen), New Leaf (the 3Ds is my first ever console I bought), and City Folk ( which is just Wild World with more updated graphics and some extras).

I think The only one I haven´t played yet is Horizons, and speaking of unplayed games.

I decided to visit for the very first time the first generation on GameCube, just to see how it all began.

All I needed for this session was an emulator both on my PC and Phone, Google drive so I can easily transfer my save files between devices and a Rom.

And who know I might make this into a series.

So here´s my life in Animal Crossing.


![rover who is a blue cat in a sweater asking me if i have a second](/images/2023/rovercrossing.jpeg#original)


First guy I meet is Rover on a train, which I´m familiar with since he also shows up in New Leaf.

He asks me some questions and usual I had to look up a guide to get the apperance I want, for some reason I always make my characters look stoned.

And of course after finding out I didn´t have a house he sets me up with Tom Nook, and I swear those too are part of some real estate scheme.

I arrive then at Batvale, which by the way I always I name every single Animal Crossing Town that. I dunno its sounds cute I guess.

<figure>


![tom nook the racoon trying to sell a house even offering to throw in a radio for free](/images/2023/animalcorssingtommeeting.jpeg#original "Thanks Tom, I guess?
")


And speak of the Devil guess who meets me at the Train Station and lets me have a pick of the houses.

One Thing I noticed unlike newer version you can´t pick the location, it´s all already been pre determined. My only choice in the matter is which color on the roof I wanna pick. I choose the one with the red roof.

Afterwards, Nook tells me to go to his store which is where I will get the Tutorial portion of the game.

I gotta say walking through the Town takes me a while to get used too, instead of the seamless rolling log effect, instead the screen just scrolls over everytime I get at the end of an area.

And I dont have a map yet except for those boards, Nook did indeed chastised me for taking too long. Like dude, I just got here.

Being hired as his first and probably only employee, I planton some flowers and trees, and during break I get the opportunity to meet the rest of the locals.

Some are familiar.


![meeting tortimer the turtle mayor who tells me how disapointende he is in the newer generation](/images/2023/animalcrossingtortimer.jpeg#original)

Note he´s telling this cuz I told him I love my Mom.

And yes that´s the mayor but there´s no office like in later version of the game, except he sometimes hangs out at this fountain. This will probably be important later.

The Sable Sisters are here, however they don´t sell clothes, instead they just display patterns. I guess the developers realized later down the line it would make better sense if this was a clothing store.


![Blather´s a brown owl](/images/2023/animalcrossingblathers.jpeg#original)


There´s also good Old Blathers, the museum seems a lot smaller here, also his little sister seems absent.

Next stop the post office, the same two seagull gals are there. However I found out I must make my house payments directly to the post office. That atm machine over there is only the e-reader, which I´m guessing it was the precursor to the Amiibo.

The recycling bin is also absent, instead there´s the dump where I can just leave all my trash there, or find items (you know what they say another´s man´s trash is another man´s treasure).

![booker the police dog asking me if that shirt is mine](/images/2023/animalcrossingpolicestation.jpeg#original)


The old police station is there, complete with its lost and found section. They absolutely will not care if you take other people´s stuff.

That being said let´s meet the villagers. Now Imagine my suprise when I found these guys in Town.


![tom the blue cat asking the player. Hey! Who are you!? Why are you talking to me](/images/2023/animalcrossingtomcat.jpeg#original "Omg! I loved you in Tom and Jerry! Can you give me an autorgraph?")

Wait a minute... a cat named Tom?

And a brown mouse...? There´s something oddly familiar about [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGszF2xOG2o)

As of this post here are the current villagers:

- [Tabby](https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Tabby)

- [Tom](https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Tom)

- [Chico](https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Chico)

- [Poncho](https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Poncho)

- [Cashmere](https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Cashmere)

- [Jambette](https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Jambette)

Now that break is over it´s time to do post some ads, and delivery service.

And that when things went to hell, I was supposed to deliver something to Poncho but I couldn´t find him. I was also sent on a wild goose chase.


![tabby the orange cat saying: Oh, no! you didn´t come for the Pokmeon Pikachu did you, me- WOW?](/images/2023/animalcrossingtabbydelivery.jpeg#original)


I´d go to someone then they say they didn´t have it, they gave to someone else and I better pray that they´re near home.

To add to the weirdness for some reason they both wanted me to retrieve their Pokemon Pikachu ( a reference to the Pocket Pikachu).

When all of that was finished I was finally free to do whatever, Nook let me go (keeping a job must be hard in this economy). And then imediatly closed shop because it was 10:00 pm. But before giving me a map (finally I was starting to worry about getting lost).


![player character saying: I´m finally done working!
I´m free! I´m free!](/images/2023/animalcrossingdeliverydone.jpeg#original)

Aftewards I decided to explore a bit more , and realizing there´s wasn´t much else to do (i mean i lack all the main tools for gathering) I went back home and decided to do some decorating with all the items I just received as payment.


![jambette ofering a piece of furniture](/images/2023/animalcrossingjambettefurniture.jpeg#original)

Home, Sweet Home.
