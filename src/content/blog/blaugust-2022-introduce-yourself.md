Oh boy is it week 2 already? Time flies.

I´ve already made a small introduction about this blog, but how about myself?

Well, lets start by talking about my first foray in the world of blogging, my first time was actually from a school project in my teens.

My classmates and I picked Cervical Cancer Awareness as our theme, and we did the whole shebang! We made printed t-shirts for our group, brochures, a powerpoint presentation, as well an educational blog.

We used blogspot (nowadays its called blogger), I remember still trying to figure out how to put up a theme and how to write posts.

Then when I got to college I ended up on tumblr. My initial intention was to create a blog about videogames, or maybe like a nature blog, based of my the degree I was studying at time (Ecology would you believe it, still trying to figure out what to do with that.)

Sadly that didn't came to fruition because I quickly lost interest, and realize it was much fun to just post/reblog about fandoms, and random stuff. Not to mention Tumblr was so far from traditional blogging, it was what is now called a microblog platform.

I didn´t put a lot of thought in what I wrote, I would just write whatever random opinion or though I have. While that was freeing, I did feel like something was missing.

I think it was during the pandemic I started taking blogging a bit more seriously, I started writing for this small obscure website that would pay people for each article they wrote. It didn´t pay much but it was an extra bit of income, plus I would write about what I love.

Eventually, I came to a realization of why should I work for another website when I can just make my own, so I looked and I looked and need up picking Wordpress as my platform of my choice.

While I barely haven´t got any income from this, I still liked the idea of having my own space just for my own writings. And the rest is history.

As for my personal history, I´m still figuring out what to write at the time of this post.

I could say I´m a huge nerd, as a kid and even into adulthood I was into science specially biology. The thing that really helped me get into it besides documentaries, was educational videogames.

Yall remember the magic school bus? Besides the tv show they launched a series of videogames, that had a huge impact on me:

My favorite in the series, was Magic School Bus Explores the Earth, ironically that probably explains why I aced my Geology College Class, it was my most replayed game.

Which was also my first step into the videogame world, I may have expanded my taste since then. In my teens is when I got really into MMOs, starting with runescape and Perfect World.

They were a lot more easily available for a kid with a limited budget, it was also around that time I figured how to pirate things and console emulations, allowing me to pretty much play pokemon on PC to my hearts content.

Speaking about emulation, in Adulthood, I discovered the concept of private servers, which allowed me to play World of Warcraft exactly as it was when it was first launched and even some defunct online games like City of Heroes.

While getting deeper into gaming, dealing with college and the first steps of adulting. I also discovered photography.

My parents decided to gift me a Camera as my Graduation present, which I wasted no time taking it for a spin (but sadly my first photos were lost to time because I didn't bother to make backups, RIP).

I actually found that one of my classmates had a deviantnart account dedicated to artistic photography, and during a field class where we learned the basics of birdwatching, another different classmate bought his digital character in order to capture birds.

This made me a bit curious about the field of nature photography, changing more or less what I though of it, from something that people just used for their family album, to a creative medium of itself.

Also, it became important for fieldwork. When I was doing a college internship about bats and how they were being affected by the local construction of a dam, I took my camera with me to capture some images to use for my report.

It was fun and I learned a lot, would I be able to make a career out of it? Who knows. So far know this is just a hobby for me.

But hey at least they make good blogging material, as I found out there are still people out there who like learning about different species out there, beyond just looking at cute pictures.

I often take my time to learn about each animal I found, and then use that information to accompany my photo posts.

So basically I like that blog can have a sort of educational purpose as well as to entertain.

Hope all you readers out there have gotten to know me a little bit better and some of what inspired me to make this blog.

Next week, it will be creative appreciation, where of course I´ll be talking a bit more about my favorite media. Stay tuned, for more of my posts!
