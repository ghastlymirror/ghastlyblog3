October is finally here, the time of pumpkin carving, Halloween decorations, candy costumes, and horror movie marathons. And the perfect time to play some spooky games.

But if you´re anything like me finding good ones to play can be a challenge, since most game lists only have horror games as suggestions. While I enjoy horror, I can be a bit of a scaredy-cat when it comes to gaming, mostly because of how immersive this medium really is unlike a book or a movie.

So, for those of you who still want in on the fun, here is my personal curated list of games with a spooky theme, but are more tolerable to the non-horror fun. Just a warning, just because they´re low on the scary factor doesn´t mean they don´t have dark themes or creepy moments. They are only here because scaring the player isn´t the main point.

That said here are my entries.

## 1. Flipping Death

![Flipping Death Game Cover](/images/2022/flippingdeath.jpg#center)

This one is a very creative and fun game that I experienced last year. Made by the same people behind Stick It to the Man, it tells the tale of a young woman who recently died and end up in the afterlife (around Halloween no less). She finds herself temporarily filling in for the Grim Reaper who decided to go on a vacation. Now with the power of flipping between the world of the living and the dead, she runs around helping ghosts move on, as well figuring out who is possessing her old body.

The game is a puzzle platform with a fun possession mechanic. You can control the characters' limbs and create all kinds of shenanigans. The thing I enjoyed was the cardboard style of the environment. It feels like your playing through a popup book, making it stand out from other games. Also, it´s got a lot of comedic dialogue.

## 2. Death and Taxes

There are only two things certain in life, death and taxes, so the saying goes. In this game, you play as a bureaucratic Grim Reaper in charge of deciding who lives and who dies. The game has a playstyle similar to Papers Please, where you have to fill reports and fill quotas if you want to keep your job. Every choice you make will impact the story, giving you different endings every time you start a new game.

But unlike Papers, ironically lighthearted, in dialogue and some game mechanics. Instead of worrying about making ends meets, your salary can be used to buy trinkets that can help with your gameplay, as a fun novelty, or to customize your Reaper appearance. And the best part is, you get to keep your upgrades the next time you start a new session, making this a very replayable game.

## 3. Among US

![Among Us Game Cover](/images/2022/amongus.jpg#center)

I think this game needs no introduction, considering its popularity recently. As for why it´s on this list, you might be asking, how such a goofy colorful game has a spooky theme? Well, first there´s the main premise: a group of people who are stuck together in an isolated area except one of them is an impostor who tries to kill the crew one by one, creating sabotages, and the group has to figure their identity. Tensions and distrust run high.

If you think about it at its core, this plot is very similar to the movie The Thing, where an alien disguised as one of the researchers and tries to assimilate them, while the researchers try to figure out who is human and who´s the alien.

It doesn't help that the game theme is similar to the movie soundtrack, one of the killing animations implies the impostor might be something other than human, and they even have a blood test as one of the tasks. Plus the POLUS map is practically the North Pole research station from the movie.

Even though I didn´t find this game scary, I still felt a bit paranoid whenever I went to a room with vents to complete tasks, or wonder if the other player I´m following can be trusted. On the flip side of being The Impostor, you always have to worry about being found out, especially if it´s one against an entire group. You will have to use your wits and collaborate with other players to win this game.

But on the fun side, this game also has cool hats and costumes to dress up your crew member, which is already a traditional Halloween activity. So, grab a couple of friends and experience a horror movie scenario.

## 4. Night in The Woods

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nc6f9llfs0w?si=c85Gr2r0jvFohhof" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In this exploration game, you play as Mae, a college dropout who returns to her old crumbling mining town and try to bond with old friends while figuring out what she wants in life. Meanwhile, strange things start to happen after dark, and there´s a mystery to be solved in the woods.

This game has a very relaxed but melancholic feel to it. You spend the entire game interaction with other characters to dialogue choices, exploring the town, and learning more about Mae´s past. Most of the story seems to take place during Autumn, as you notice the leaves falling and Halloween decorations start popping up as the story progresses, hence why it´s on this list.

Besides exploring the games gives tons of things to do, you get to play a game within a game in Mae´s laptop, and even music minigames. The 2D graphics and the fact that it´s a town populated by talking animals gives it a certain charm.

## 5. They Bleed Pixels

This is a very challenging platform game inspired by Lovecraft and traditional horror. In this cute pixelated game, you play as a young girl who arrives at the Lafcadio Academy for Troubled Young Ladies. She suffers from terrible nightmares and travels to other worlds where she has to fight monsters. Unlucky for her, those dreams are leaking out into the real world and slowly warping her flesh to resemble the horrors she´s facing.
It´s up to the player if she finally destroys what is the cause of her predicament, or she embraces her transformation as an eldritch horror.

The game has plenty of levels to play through, and difficulty levels according to each player´s skill.

## 6. Monster Prom (and Camp)

![Monster Prom Cover](/images/2022/monsterprom.jpg#center)

This is a very cute game. In this dating sim, you play as a student looking to ask one of the many monsters in school for prom, which is basically the main appeal for the monster lover in you. You got a variety of characters, from hipster vampire, jock werewolf, to mermaid princess.

The game mechanics are simple enough, throughout the term you can choose to go to classes to increase your stats, buy items, or just mess around, stats are important as they determine whether your monster bae will or not accept your invitation. You also get scenes where you can interact with other students, and the dialogue choices in-game will affect your character's favor.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1z-cl_lCrTQ?si=d8zrfbHHcxTPr_Gh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

However, there a lot of variety when comes to dialogue and endings, so no two games are ever the same. The game actually has a meter where you can see how many stuff you unlocked. I actually love the cute character designs and hilarious dialogue. I actually followed the writer´s previous work, the Zeus Grants Stupid Wishes Book, a hilarious retelling of mythology.
The game also has a competitive mode, which is a first for dating sims. You can just play locally or online, where you and other players compete for their favorite monster, making this the perfect party game. You can play a short or a long gameplay session

Due to its popularity, they have just published the sequel called Monster Prom 2: Monster Camp, which takes your favorite monsters on a summer camp.

## 7. Wailling Heights

This is also another monster mash game. In this musical adventure you play as Frances Finklestein​ the ex-manager of a band called the Deadbeats. You arrive in a town full of monsters due to a business proposal and get arrested because being alive is a crime here. After gaining the power of possession, you have the ability to hop on different bodies and use their powers to get one step closer to escape. And your old band wants to get back together.

Like any good adventure game you will talk to different characters, explore the area and collect lyrics. Music plays a big part in this game, and being able to compose a song will allow you to possess new monsters. And this is all done with a catchy soundtrack.

## 8. Pumpkin Jack

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bZ-bqqDVOU8?si=3wIuoVXnH5ast5Jx" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This game just screams Halloween to me. This a 3d platformer where you play as the Pumpkin Lord travelling through a cursed land. They are plenty of puzzles to solves, weapons to unlock, and recruitable companions all in a very spooky but cartoony setting.
This game kinda reminds me of MediEvil, due to the style and hack and slash mechanics. If you loved that game, then you will really appreciate this homage. It was newly released this year and is available for a variety of platforms.

## 9. Afterparty

Created by the same people behind Oxenfree, you play as Milo and Lola, two college students who end up in hell. But to get out they have to outparty Satan himself! Like Oxenfree it has an interesting dialogue system that affects the story, you continue the conversation or just not say anything at all. You get to explore a colorful underworld and do a variety of activities, like playing ping-pong, dance battles, and getting drinks.

It´s the perfect spooky party without even having to leave the house.

## 10. Graveyard Keeper

Think Stardew Valley but spookier. In this game, you get to manage your very own cemetery. But that is not all, you can use body parts as a resource in this, even though it´s questionable. Explore a medieval world where witches burnings are a thing, grow crops, meet npcs, face moral dilemmas and expand on the history of this world.

It also has decent DLC. It´s first one, Stranger Sins, has a new storyline and allows you to also open a tavern. There is also another one just released, Game of Crone. This one brings a bunch of new mechanics, a refuge camp, and even a quest involving a vampire attacking a village. Really appropriate for this season.

## Honorable Mentions
In order to avoid this list becoming too long, here a few short entries:

 - [Secret World Legends](https://store.steampowered.com/app/215280/Secret_World_Legends/), an urban fantasy MMORPG 
-  [Stygian](https://store.steampowered.com/app/779290/Stygian_Reign_of_the_Old_Ones/)
-   [Gibbous](https://store.steampowered.com/app/914020/Gibbous___A_Cthulhu_Adventure/) (both games inspired by Lovecraft), 
-   [MachiaVillain](https://store.steampowered.com/app/555510/MachiaVillain/), a haunted house manager game
  
-    [Carrion](https://store.steampowered.com/app/953490/CARRION/), a game where you are the monster. It´s a bit gory, but it is a nice change of pace from running from a horror to actually being one.

- [A Vampyre Story](https://store.steampowered.com/app/313870/A_Vampyre_Story/)

- [Unavowed](https://www.gog.com/en/game/unavowed), an urban fantasy point and click adventure

There is also the Halloween mission from [Bully](https://store.steampowered.com/app/12200/Bully_Scholarship_Edition/), or as I like to it call GTA, the Highschool Years. Because this game is set during the course of a school year, you can´t have crazy teen shenanigans without some Halloween pranks. The mission is unlocked one hour into the game. 

You get to wear a skeleton costume, play pranks on the students, smash some pumpkins and use the old dog poop on fire trick to mess with the headmaster. I think this was one of the more entertaining parts of the game.

## Final Thoughts

So, there you have it, a bunch of spooky theme games enough to tide players over this season, specially when you´re celebrating it at home or not live in a place where it is a cultural tradition.

Happy Halloween!
