Hey there, so this Post marks the beginning of the Blaugust event, where I try to blog as many times possible during the Month of August. Hard to believe I´ve been participating for what, three years now? Except for that one year where I didn´t join, for reasons I´ve already [talked about](/blog/blaugust-2025-were-back-baby).

Why did I say as many times? Well, I´ve never managed to fufill the 31 posts mark in all this time, mostly because I have of stuff going on even during the Summer. Also I´ve been spending my holiday most of it with family or going through the beach, so I don´t have acess to my computer most of the time, and I don´t like writing on a phone that much.

I´m also not the type of person to plan beforehand on already working on my blog, I´m more of the go with the flow type. Sometimes I would do fuck all until suddendly a random idea. Sometimes when I´m playing a game, or go for a walk or when I´m even in the shower, turns out, that is the one best places to have ideas who knew.

Althought, I am lying a little bit here, I did spend last Month trying to come with stuff I did want to write. I was think for examples games I´ve been playing this summer, personal media recomendations, maybe post a photo of two.

I guess I´ve always used this event to challenge myself, I always find out that having a deadline, kinda forces me to actually write at least something, so that is one of the benefits of this event.

The other advantage, this leads me to always have more visitors to my blog during this time of year, mostly other praticipants, either old readers or people are just finding out about my site for the first time. That is sorta why I created it in the first place, I like having people reading my stuff and then me their thought about it.

While one could argue you should just write for yourself, I think if i wanted to do I would just write it in a journal. But I like sharing stuff to the world, and I´m not just writting for myself, but for other people who might share similar interests.

Plus I got to meet a lot interesting people ever since I started in this blogging journey, I also often haven went out of my own way to read articles made by other people who join in on Blaugust and some of them have become frequent online ready, with me adding them to my rss feed and blogroll.

I hope that things this year will be just as interesting, so happy Blaugust!
