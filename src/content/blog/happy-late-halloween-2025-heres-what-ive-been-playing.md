description: I was supposed to upload this in Octorber but life got in my way so consider this my  late halloween/christmas celebration and what I´ve played.
---

 I was gonna upload this last October maybe in November , but life got in the way so consider this my late Halloween/Christmas Hybrid celebration.
I do hope yall had fun, between all the costumes or whatever you ghouls do this time of year.
As for me I´ve been mostly been at home playing games, as for movies not so much. I think I only watch like two which was Blade and Sinners and that Buffy the Vampire Slayer Halloween episode.

You know, the one where everyone gets turned into their costumes and chaos ensues, good stuff.
And when it comes to what I´ve been playing this season, that most of them have been old games. 

I don´t know why I´m starting to prefer them to more modern titles. But I felt like going on a old-school trip this year.
Without further ado here´s the titles I´ve been checking out and maybe you might wanna check them out too, even we though are no longer in the most scary season of the year, or are we?

## Piglet´s Big Game

![Piglets big game cover](/images/2025/pigletsbiggame.jpg#medium)

Ok, most people have probably heard of this title as a meme, being famous for having some unnerving stuff for kids games, that its now known as baby´s first Silent Hill or Resident Evil.

For me personally I see it more as Disney´s Psychonauts .

Now was it worth the hype? Gotta say this game has one of the best environmental designs I ´ve seen in an old game, I think my favorite is Roo´s dream where everything is made out of cardboard and painted with crayons.

And yes it does some creepy moments, even early on in the game where you explore pooh dream and suddenly there these very empty (save for enemies) rooms, with odd angles and an unsettling gramophone playing.

That being said there is only two levels that would fit more in a horror game (think Eeyore´s gray mansion, and owl´s surreal library setting). With Rabbit´s being the more lighthearted being in a normal woods setting.

All and all, its not exactly something that would scare a grown up, but I can see this design creep out kids, which is appropriate considering this a game where Piglet has to fights his own fears to help his friends.

Despite that is still a kid´s game and it still retains some of the cute and funny elements that come from a Winnie the pooh story. One part that got me giggling was whenever I unlocked the faces used to scare enemies. And they brought on board the same voice actors that work on previous Pooh movies and cartoons.

Just a word of warning though, while this is not a hard game for the majority of its run, there was this sudden spike in difficulty in the last section. Not only was it a timed mission, the button combination to scare enemies was so long that I was never fast enough to defeat them.

I had to cheat a little bit and lower the speed on my emulator, otherwise it was unplayable for me. There´s was also a stealth and running segments. Where Pooh or Tigger would be playable, I didn´t like those very much.

It felt like I was constantly ambushed by enemies if I so much as turn the wrong corner, and Tigger´s jumping speed is too slow (with the added bonus of alerting the heffalump s and woozles in the area), so take that in mind.

## Medievil

![Medievil Game Cover](/images/2025/medievil.jpg#medium)

From what I´ve heard this is seems to be a very much beloved classic from the Original Playstation era.
You play as Sir Daniel Fortesque , a poor smuck who had the humilitating misfortune of dying a few mintues after the battle of Gallowmere had started (and got remembered as hero despite this), now thank to a spell by an evil wizard to create an army of the dead, Sir Dan has risen as a skeleton man with only one eye and lacking a jaw.

Its now up to him to finally live up to his reputation and to save the kingdom.

If I could describe Sir Dan here, it would be as an undead version of Blackadder, cowardly but sarcastic and if somehow found himself in a Tim Burton Movie.

I haven´t managed to get very far in the game (I´m still stuck fighting the graveyard guardians boss), but from little I´ve seen .yeah this games screams Halloween. The old playstation graphics make it even more eerie, and I´m constantly being kept on my toes whenever an undead enemy shows. And it starts at a cemetery, of all things.

But being a very old game, the controls feels a bit janky, I was always constantly falling on water and dying in the most stupid way possible, that can kill my enjoyment a little bit.

Also if you missed a certain item, like let´s say a chalice when you finished a level? You can go back, but you gotta replay the level again. That is one thing I´m  not gonna miss when playing a more modern game.

## Vampire Survivors

![Vampire survivors cover](/images/2025/vampiresurvivors.jpg)

How could a simple game being so addictive and hard to put the down? So, you´re a monster hunters of sorts, you´re main goal is to try to survive as long as possible by avoiding the hoards of monsters trying to kill you.

Easy to learn, until over time you get new types of monsters, and attack that throw out of a loop, suddenly being surround by a circle of carnivorous plants wave after of wave of skeletons with no way out.

But hey at least you can get new weapons and upgrades with each level. This is more a trial and error is that I had to experiment which items would make it easier. I tried my fair share of combinations like projectiles to a weapon that temporarily freezes enemies and allows to pass by them, or area damaging items like garlic that can kills monsters if they so much as get too close to me.

The games goes of its way to keep on your toes, just when you figured out a got strategy, then Bam  It hits with another unhinged horde of monsters faster and stronger than the rest. It can be frustrating of times, though.

There´s s some challenges and achievements, completing them will allow you to unlock more characters and levels.

Appearance wise, I can see they are playing homage to the Castlevania series and I´m not just talking about its pixelated graphics. You do start off playing as a vampire hunter with whip, which gives the games its charm.

And good news, turns out there is a Castlevania DLC, if you really wanna bring this game back to its roots.

## Hollywood Monsters

![hollywood monster cover](/images/2025/hollywoodmonsters.png#original)

Another game I didn´t went very far, I could only describe this as your old point and click adventure game made by a Spanish studio and set in a version of our world where famous horror monsters are actual movie stars.

In the first part of a game you play as a female journalist who went to a part to interview all these famous celebrities, only to go missing. Afterwards you play as her colleague trying to figure out why she hasn´t showed and find yourself deep in some mystery rabbit hole.

It wasn´t that hard for me to figure some of the puzzles in the first couple of minutes but the problem game when there was a timed one. So i had to try and get a key from the security gard that needed a distraction. But do to how the inventory commands was set up i had to replay said distraction several times before succeeding.

It was at this point I had been thinking about giving up this game, thinking it might be broken gameplay wise for me.

It does have your typical quirky lucasarts type of humor that is often the bread and butter of the genre. And most of the funny part come from the fact these are your typical universal monsters in a Hollywood setting, making comment of their roles and celebrity gossip. If you´re into that kind of thing.

If I ever get around finishing this I might write a full review.

## Fusion Fall Retrobution

![a game character looking like an orange grim reaper](/images/2025/fusionfallhalloween.png)

I´ve been revisiting this old but officially defunct MMORPG, think of it as Epic crossover where characters from Cartoon Network shows have banded together against an alien foe who seeks to infect and assimilate planet earth. All while having an anime aesthetic, cause that was the cool style of the time. (I still feel odd seeing the Ed Edd and Eddy characters drawn like that).

I remember playing this one around 2009, but only got to level 10 because then game started asking for a subscription back in the day, so I moved on and forgot about until the last moment when it became completely free to play but by then it was already on its last legs and got shutdown in 2013.

But luckily old fans have created private servers, so I finally have the chance to explore the rest of the game. The one I´m currently using is Retrobution, for adding constant updates even stuff that wasn´t the original, including frequent in-game events.

While I was at it, I got into this years Halloween event, which started in end of October and has lasted well into November.

To participate I just had to head out to a Cemetery in Eternal Vistas, talk to Jeff the Spider (for all you the Grim Adventures Bill and Mandy are familiar with) and got a quest that had me hunting dozens and dozens of Pumpkin monsters for a special Jack O'Lantern hat.

And that is not all, killing these guys would give out Halloween themed loot for that ideal scary costume, and of course I was on the lookout for a very special feather drop. Why, you ask? Because I wanted that Jack Nano, baby! 

Which is just a collectible miniature version of a cartoon character that gives you special combat ability, but hey he looks good with my setup.

Now the problem with kinds of old resurrected mmos is that isn´t a lot of players, and least not in massive numbers when it was still active leaving most of the game feeling quite empty, and normally you would be right.

However, when I went there it was packed with people and I had no difficulty in finding a party to go monster hunting with.  It was nice seeing that this games community was still active. 

In comparison to other Halloween style events in others mmo this felt a bit simplistic but at least I got a cool flying broom out of it, and the dark atmosphere in the cemetery was a plus.

## Twisted Wonderland

![A green haired anime character in a stripped suit standing next to jack skellington a cartoon skeleton](/images/2025/twistedwonderlanhalloween.png)

I don´t typical recommend Gatchas. But I´ve been playing this one on my phone a lot, and between being a huge fan of Disney Villains and the Manga/anime series Black Butler I had to give this one a try.


To summarize you, yes literally you. Have been isekaied in a Magical Academy in another world. With no other choice you end up getting enrolled in the school despite not being able to do any magic, in hopes of finding a way back home. As well as dealing the drama involving an all male student cast who could use some goddamn therapy.

There´s also the fact that all the characters have been inspired (or shall we say twisted) from different Disney characters and they are sorted in Hogwarts Style student Dorms according to which Movie they were based on. So this one is for all you Disney fans out there.

In terms of gameplay is mostly a visual novel with some turn-based combat and rhythm sections.

But the reason it´s on this list its due to its Halloween events that happen every year. And this year we had not one but three events they brought back from previous years. Which is great for me, since I only started playing this year and I´m glad they are giving new players and opportunity to experience them.

The first two were based off the Hunchback of Notre Dame and Pinocchio. But the last one that really fits the season, was based off the Nightmare Before Christmas.

In this event the Students of Night Raven College stumble upon a magic book that transports them to Halloween Town, where they meet the characters from the movie, and Jack promises to find them  a way back if they were to help throw the best Halloween ever.

They also meet a fellow mage from their world Skully Graves, no prizes for who he´s based off.

![A pale young man with white hair wearing black rounded glasses and a formal black suit with white stripes givinng his hand](/images/2025/skullygraves.jpg)

This has been my favorite event so far. It was fun watching al these characters interacting with the bizarre denizens of Halloween town. And I did like the outfits they were wearing, specially Leona´s who looks, kinda Badass with the eye patch. (I was lucky enough to pull him).

I do think it was missed opportunity not to have Oogie Boogie, specially when there is a running joke of Jamil having a phobia of bugs. That is one missed comedy opportunity there.

However, I heard that Japanese version is revisiting this setting this year with a brand new winter event and yes Oogie Boogie fans rejoice, plus we get a brand new character based on him as well. But it will be while before we will even see this one in the western version, so the only to even experience this is through fan translations on youtube or simply download that version.

And also they just premiered the Anime Adaptation, if a Gatcha Visual Novel game isn´t your cup of tea and you just wanna experience the story you know have that as an option.

I don´t know if they will ever adapt the events on screen, but who knows, maybe if the anime becomes popular enough.

## Honorable Mentions

These are games I´ve already mentioned before on this blog, but I figured I´d give them a little shoutout.

Let´s see, there´s A Vampyre Story, a point and click adventure game from the late 2000s, that looks like the love child of Monkey Island and a Tim Burton Animated Movie. 

I´ve played this one previously but I decided to revisit again. Between be able to play as a vampire, the beautiful backgrounds, clever puzzle (some of which were inspired by vampire lore) and its humor, makes this a worthwhile title for this holiday. And I´m not just talking about Halloween, the game is set in during a snowy winter, which does help to get in the spirit of things.

Also there´s some news about a sequel in development. Yes, you hear me right. After years of years of waiting, thinking that series was practically abandoned we are finally gonna see the continuation of this game that ended ins a cliffhanger. It will probably published in 2026 so keep your eyes peeled for [this one](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3273370/A_Vampyre_Story_A_Bats_Tale/).

Lastly, there is Yokai Watch, after I took a break from it in September, I decided to pick it up again, considering the whole supernatural yokai theme. So far I  investigated a construction site that is being haunted the most terrifying yokai in the game. Playing this on actual 3DS with the 3d effect on made it all the more eerie.  Imagine exploring an abandoned location only to see a giant scary face staring at you.

And pretty much it for this year´s Halloween gaming. And even though Christmas is almost near the corner by time of this post, I still recommend you at least check these out. Winter Months are the darkest of the year after all.
