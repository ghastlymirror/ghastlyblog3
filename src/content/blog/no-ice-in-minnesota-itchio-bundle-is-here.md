 ![No Ice In Minnesota Itch.io Charity Bundle](/images/blog/noice.jpg#center)


The fine indie developers and artists of Itch.io have banded together to create a charity bundle dealing with current events in the US with the ICE raids. Which has been heartbreaking to see.

Proceeds will go towards the [Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota](https://www.ilcm.org/), their current goal is $500,000.0, but I have a feeling that they will complete the goal in a matter of days.

What can you expect from this bundle, well for just 10$ (you also the option to give more if you´re feeling generous), you will have acess to dozens of digital as well physical games, tools and books.

Some of the titles that caught my attention were Calico (cat taming and cafe sim), Apico (a beekeeping game), Baba is You. If you´re more into rolling the dice there is Glitter Hearts inspired by the magical girl genre.

But if you´re more of a solo player, there stuff in the there for you too like Whispers in the Walls, a mystery solo journaling game.

All in all for a good cause. This bundle be available until 13 March for those interested.
