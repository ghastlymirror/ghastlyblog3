![The Longing Game Cover](/images/blog/the-longing-game-cover.jpg)

I´ve played this game last year, back at the height of the Pandemic Lockdown, and I would often use videogames as a way to cope with that. But no game resonated with me more than a small indie game called The Longing by Studio Seufz.

If I had to describe it it´s basically a Tamagotchi meets idle gameplay meets exploration game with light puzzling on the side.

And even though things have opened up, this game stuck with me in a way that most fast-paced games don´t. So what should you expect going into this?

Well...

## Objective, what Objective?

At the start of the game, a small Shade is told by the King of the Underworld that he will sleep for 400 days, and once that time is up he is supposed to wake up and end "All Longing". In the meantime, you (or precisely the Shade) are free to do whatever you please during that time, but whatever you do, DO NOT GO OUTSIDE.

Funny considering that I was in that same position when I played this game.

So, what can you do then? Just explore the underground caves I guess, and find some stuff to pass the time.  There really is not much of an objective and there are no enemies to fight or barely any characters to interact, its just you and the darkness.

You even have a small cave of your very one to decorate, this serves as your Homebase and you fill it with whatever stuff you find in your adventures. Explore every nook and cranny, heck you don´t even have to play the game.

No, really. See, time passes by in real-time (although there are ways to make it faster) even when the game is closed. So, you can always take the lazy route, just open the game once to get it started and open again once the 400 days are up, but that wouldn´t be nearly as fun as actually playing it.

Or you can take the bait and actually disregard the King´s warnings on going to the surface just to see what happens. The choice is yours

## Home Sweet Home

Anyway, at the start of the game the Shade´s home was pretty much empty with only a few books. So, after doing some digging I´ve managed to fill the wall with paintings that I made the Shade draw with materials I found, a couple of crystals here, some treasure.

I also tried to fill up the bookshelf. Speaking of which, you can read the books yourself with are all full public domain works, like Moby Dick. There´s also a journal that describes things the Shade wants to do if you´re at a loss on what to see next. Think of it as more of a bucket list.

You can also write a book of your own by editing the game files. Use it as your personal diary or write that smutty fanfiction you never had the courage to publish. I´m sure the Shade will appreciate it.

## Exploration

The Underground Kingdom is huge, there are a lot of places to explore and secrets to discover, but it is really easy to get lost in these big labyrinth-like stairs and corridors. Fortunately, the game allows you to register noteworthy places should you ever need to revisit them, and believe me you will have to do it often.

Controls are simple, just point and click with the mouse in which direction you want to go or objects to interact. But one warning, the walking speed is really slow, but you can just ask him to go to an area, turn off the game, and come back.

But Some places are blocked by certain obstacles that require you to wait. Remember how I mentioned this game runs on real-time?

Well, some obstacles can require players to wait a couple of days or weeks, such as this water pit:

I think I had to wait a long time for it to fill up, up till then it didn´t even occur to me I could just mess with time. So, I waited a whole month before I visited it again, like a dummy.

Despite all this I was patient, and I got to see some really cool locations such as this crystal fountain:

This cool glowing mushroom cave:

A cool treasure room behind indestructible glass, where I broke my pickaxe when I hit it.

But the one that stood out was the Halls of Eternity, just one long corridor that never seems to end:

*Only a fool dares to try to reach the end of eternity* so says the journal, and that fool is me. And while it seems like an impossible task, it is filled with treasures for me to bring home, this is where I got my curtains, carpets, and a horse head. There was also more drawing paper for my sketches. There are rewards for those brave enough to traverse it.

That being said it does get very lonely at times without so much as seeing a soul, except for this face in the wall:

If you speak to it and offer it items, it will give out some hints. One of which is the best to get to the surface. You learn it is a very dangerous journey, that involves traveling in complete darkness. I was curious to see what would happen if I did it.

That being said I enjoyed some of the 2d visuals, the sketch-like graphics made this game look like an art piece. The music has this atmospheric but dreary sound in the form of dungeon synth music that is a constant reminder of how alone my character is.

Speaking of which:

## The Protagonist

Over the course of the game, I even got found of my little Shade with his cute but creepy design, just a little black goblin with teeth. Every once in a while he will comment on his surroundings, and if you leave him long enough you might find him asleep or sitting.

At one point as I decorated the cave, it became less about aesthetics and more about making a nice place for him to live in. I even build him a bed and a shower.

My favorite thing to do before I turned off the game was to simply get him on his comfortable sofa have him read his books (there is an idle option).



## Game Rating

This is a very interesting experimental game. It allows the player to form their own path, do you simply wait? Do you try to escape this world? Or are you a full explorer? This little gem offers a unique experience from the typical fast-paced games that we´ve been accustomed to. This is the kind of game that makes people reflect on their feelings of solitude, longing, and a sense of purpose.

The Longing might not be for everyone due to its slow pace, but for the more casual player looking for a relaxing game, this is a must-play.
