Ah Summer, that time of the year where you can take a break and relax, maybe go on to the beach, or a vacation. In my case I´ve been taking a virtual vacation, in between moments of swimming in the ocean, or going sightseeing.

The problem with this much free time, (and a huge backlog) it was hard to choose what to play to I narrowed down to couple of these titles, sure they not all be what you think of a summer themed game, but these are the ones for one way or another called to me:


## Yokai Watch

![Yokai Watch Poster](/images/2025/yokaiwatch.jpg#medium)

 I´ve been playing this game for while now, on and off, for about almost 2 years. What happens I will pick it up play for an hour or two then not touch it for months on end. However, this Summer I´ve been trying to try and tackle it. I´m already at the Chapter where you confront a Fox Yokai.

Now, when Yokai Watch first came on the scene, I remember people treating this as a Pokemon clone or that it would be the competitor that would overthrow Pokemon throne on the Mons genre. Both were ideas wrong, the first one because the style is so radically different, while Yokai became more of an obscure title. I mean they still make games in the series, specially for the switch, but the average person probably never heard of it.

If anything it was probably more popular in Japan if I´m not mistaken, it had an anime adaptation, several movies and even a Pokemon GO styled mobile game where you catch Yokai in real places, but was never ported to the west.

I picked this one in praticular because its set over the summer. The premise is that you´re a kid living in "Totally Not Japan We Promise", and is trying to catch bugs as a summer homework asignment, when they come across a mysterious gatchapon machine. Its from this machine that pops out Whisper, a ghost yokai that will serve as your guide for most of the game.

As thanks for releasing him, he gives you a special watch which allows you to see and talk to other yokai, and so the adventure begins.

These Yokai inspired by the ones in Japanese Mythology, are invisible being that can influence people´s behaviour and cause all kinds of mischief, they can make you depressed or acident prone.  But they can be benevolent too.

Storywise this game has very low stakes that I know so far, you´re not trying to be the champion or fight some evil mastermind. Most of the time I´ve spent here, was helping the people in this town and even Yokai with their problems. One mission ivolved me helping A Kappa like creature finding a missed item or trying to deal with a pandemic of people becoming forgetful which leads to things like forgetting about documents for an important work meeting and so forth.

I liked that sort of pace, a bit slice of life. Unlike other title s in the genre instead of capturing Yokai, you instead get to befriend them. Yep this game runs on the power of friendship. I feel like this system is luck based, you can feed the favorite item to an enemy yokai you plan to add to your roster to increase the chances of getting their medallion. But most of the time I had to find and fight the same yokai over and over. Sometimes I didnt even have do anything at all to get their friend message.

![Game screen showing several enemy yokai](/images/2025/yokaiwatchcombat.jpg#medium)

The battle is interesting, its trying to do its own thing, like having auto-battle, but you can use the dial on the bottom screen of the 3ds and turn in order to switch out Yokai, and sometimes activate their special attacks. Some people might be turned off by the combat being a bit more hands off, but I think it beats the tedium, specially when trying to grind.

Looking at it more closely, I know realize why its taking me so long to finish, there´s a lot of stuff to do. Besides the sidequests, there´s fishing and bug hunting  (that you can trade for items), when I´m out exploring there always some new dungeon in the form of alleys or sewers and some demand you level up your watch before tackling it. Evertyime I think I´ve already seen it all, some new gameplay elements is unlocked.

And then there is Terror Time, oh boy Terror Time, I never felt this anxious in a kids game. In this game mode, which can either activate randomly, late at night, or when you disobey traffics rules too many times or change the time in your 3DS, has a huge red Oni chasing after you while you try to find the exit. You can try and find the time spread out in the map during your escapes, but you also gotta deal with these smaller grey oni who will alert the Big Guy to your location.

If it catches you, it will obliterate your team, and then you will wake up without the items you found. Most of the time when it happens, I don´t even bother with the items, unless they are really close and head straight for the door. Talk about whiplash from the game´s more chill vibes.

Other than that, there isn´t much in way of scares. Also, I think I enjoy the designs for Yokai Watch more than the current Pokemon ones? Don´t get me wrong, they still have neat designs. But Yokai Watch has no problem in making things a lot weirder? I mean one yokai has the face of [handsome man in the body of a poodle](https://mtwildwood.net/yokaiMedallium/yokaiDandoodle.html) (which is based in [actual folkore](https://thehorrorcollection.com/jinmenken-japan-human-faced-dog/)), an [elephant](https://mtwildwood.net/yokaiMedallium/yokaiFidgephant.html) that makes you want to pee all the time (I´ve seen enough Shin Chan Anime to Know what the Elephant is refeering too), to a [literal buttface](https://mtwildwood.net/yokaiMedallium/yokaiCheeksqueek.html).

But don´t worry they also have their fair share of cutesy and cool Anime style characters in there too. its hard for me to pinpoint which one is my favorite. But I think I´m kinda fond of [Hidabat.](https://mtwildwood.net/yokaiMedallium/yokaiHidabat.html) Its a Hikomori Bat whose wings are a literal futon, and when it evolves It becomes a literal house with wings with its eyes poking throught a small window on its door. That is peak monster design right there considering what its referencing.

Know you might wanna wonder what about Multiplayer? Well  you could only pit your yokai against friends in local muliplayer. Wi-fi battles were only introduced in the sequel. The closest you could get to fighting other players was through streetpass. But these days, the likelyhood of someone with a 3DS, let alone someone that plays Yokai Watch passing me by in the street are very lower.

I actually had to cheat for this one, thanks to Modding my 3DS, I donwloaded an app that allows me to streetpass other players from all over the world, and also the Pretendo Project allows to receive one from your friend list as well.

If anyone reading this happens to have a 3DS is playing this game, I´m always happy to do a code exchange. All and all, I think if you like mosnter collecting games this ones is worth checking out.

## PowerWash Simulator

![Powerwash Simulator Poster](/images/2025/powerwashsimulator.jpg)

This past summer has been so hot I want to put myself under a hose, But I guess a virtual one will have to do.

This game is pretty simple, I get to run my own cleaning bussiness, doing all kinds of jobs, from cleaning cars, houses, to a whole skaketpark and make enough money to get some new tools.

The DLC, isnt half bad either, as they do these odd colaborations where you can get to clean famous vehicles like the Delorean from Back to The Future and also settings from Spongebob?

To be fair this games is a mixed bag for me, on one hand its relaxing to clean various bits of pieces, but on the other hand and specially when I´m cleaning a huge house, they can get a bit teddious, specially since I´m still in the early stages of the game and still limited on what equipment I have at the moment.
However, this game Is a lot more fun in co-op, I´ve been playing this with a friend, often we just end messing around. At one point we would either spray each other with water or play a round a football using our tool an a ball.

Also, I found I could draw stuff in the dirt, and ajust the nozzle size to use as a improvised brush, which led me to write messages, and draw as a ton of cartoon dicks and way till my friend went to the rooftop to clean where they could see it (so my humour is immature sue me).

## Bugaboo Pocket

![Bugaboo Pocket Poster](/images/2025/bugaboopocket.png#center)

I make no secret that I enjoy a good virtual pet game, I´m also really into bugs, so this next title mixes two of my favorite things.

You play as a scientist trying to raise bugs in order to restore a burned out forest eccosystem. You are given a terrarium (you can raise up to three bugs) raise them from eggs to adulthood,when they die not only will the eggs they produce will be used to progress their story, but can choose either to bury them in the garden or pin their preserved bodies to a board.

While It seems sad at first, you learn to enjoy the time you with your little crawly companion, There also cool stuff like decorating their terrarium, you can also give them a hat!

I think my favorite part is the pixelated art which is jsut nice too look at, and just makes the bugs more endearing to me. I also enjoyed the educational aspect to it. And the game screen resembles a oldschool handheld (with the skin also customizable) which makes this the perfect game to play on a steamdeck for extra immersion.

Of course, this game is not for everyone, specially if you a phobia of insects and it requeires waiting around. But I do find a chill game to play during a vacation.

## Twisted Wonderland

![Twisted Wonderland](/images/2025/twisted-wonderland.jpg#center)

I don´t normally talk much about Gacha games here, but I´m gonna make an exception. Why? Well, its a games based off Disney villains, and its story and character designs were created by none other than Yana Toboso who also made Black Butler.

And since I enjoyed both the Anime and Managa, of course I had to check it out.

Now to some of you who may have heard of this mobile title but never played it, I´m hear to clear out some misconceptions. First off, no its not an Otome game (even thought it does have visual novel elements), there is no romance whatsoever, so yes all that shipping art you been seing is incredibly misleading.

And the second is that no, the characters are not "what if Disney Villains were Anime Boys" its more like their aesthetic and even parts of their story arcs were inspired by disney movies, but otherwise they´re original characters, as for the actual villains its more complicated.

The plot here is that You (also the offical name for the palyer character is Yuu) have been isekaied into a Magic School in another world. After a incident during student orientation, the Headmaster decides to let you enroll despite not having any magic alongside a talking cat until you can find a way back home.
In return you´re asked to help  deal with the unruly student body who also their issues as well as traumas.

Ok so not do character takes inspiration from the Disney canon but students are sorted into a Dorm by the Magic Mirror a la Hogwarts and based around a specific Disney villain and their values, Queen of Hearts, Scar, Ursula, Jafar, Hades, and Maleficient.

By they also do exist in this universe but they are more akin to historical figures. The main part of the campus has a row of their statues and they´re referred as the great Seven. And people here remember them as heroes and noble figures in this worlds, which makes it even more bizzare, for expample, Jafars is remembered as the wise Vizir who tries to expose a con artist, Ursula really did help those Unfortunate souls, and Scar was a revolutionary hero who helped lift up the opressed Hyenas.

Its like I dunno, I would be like if you saw the statue of a tyrant but people saw him as a hero of the people.

Even more confusing is there also different accounts that tell the story as it happened in canon, like the Princess who fell in Love with commoner and convinced her father to change the law to marry him, or the sea princess who went to live on land and helped form an organization to support merfolk who wish to migrate there.
Its like bits of pieces of history has either been distorded or twisted over time with their true origins being forgotten, which kinda realisitc even in our world just ask any historian.

My theory is either this is an alternative universe to even the Disney canon, or again, the distortion of facts is at play here. Never mind that the player character keeps having dreams of the Villains in their original canon.

Anyway the main story of the game is divided between 7 books (and its still ongoing), each book as you deal with the problems of a different dorm and which ends on a character goiing into overblot. 

If I had to describe what Overblot is, if you ever watched Magical Girl Madoka and know what happens to magical girls when their soul gem becomes corrupted is a bit similar to that. Mages enter this super beserk mode, either through extreme negative emontions or to excessive production of Blot, a toxic byprodcut of magic.
besides a change in costume they also summon a Phantom Blot that resembles Disney Villains even more.

Aside from the visual novel chapters, in some chapter you play a rhythm game or turned based combat with the cards you collected through the gatcha system, a well as room you can decorate by crafting furniture.
I wouldn´t be too  worried about what cards to use, just use what whatever character you want provided you go out your way to level them up, which can be doen throught having characters attend lessons.

Honestly, I´ve been more invested in the story, than the collecting aspect, and I usually just prefer to save the currency for a character I really like or a specific event banner.

Yes events, despite the fact that I already read all the available main story chapters so far at the time of this writting, these events give me at least something to do while I´ll wait for an update. Last June I played throught the Lilo and Stich Event, which was fun because i got see the character hanging out with the little blue alien.

I´m also looking forward to the Anime Adaptation, i was impressed by trailer and I heard they were going to use the [Game´s Theme song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu1EdBrJeTc) for the opening.
