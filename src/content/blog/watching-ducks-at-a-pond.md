As I probably talked before, my town has a park with this huge artificial lake which is home to a lot of birds. This time the subject of my photography? Ducks! Tons of them in fact:

I think out of all the ducks the Mallard (*Anas platyrhynchos*) is my favorite because of the green head of the male. A few facts about this duck breed: They are a very social species are the main ancestor of most domestic ducks, enjoy eating plants and small animals.

They can also be found all over the world, but due to their domestication, they can end up sometimes as an invasive species in a specific area. In fact some conservation groups are worried about genetic pollution because they end up breeding with endemic duck species.  

These Ducks are also monogamous which is a contrast to other ducks species who are polygamous. Ironically both males and females become aggressive during mating season in order to ward off competitors or to attract mates. Some males have even been found attempting to mate with other males as well.

No kidding sometimes I find two male constantly swimming together, which might explain some things.

And we all know about the whole corkscrew duck genitals thing don´t we?

That being said they were a delight to watch, next time I might come and feed them.

Speaking of which, if you´re gonna feed them avoid bread since its not healthy for them, instead consider feeding them things like [**peas, rice, etc...**](https://www.backyardchickens.com/threads/the-ultimate-list-of-duck-treats-and-supplements.242460/)
