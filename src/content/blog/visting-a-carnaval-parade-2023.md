For those that live in Portugal, February is that time of the year where everyone dresses up in costumes and hold fun parades which includes themed cars, dances and the odd figure.

This weekend I got the oportunity to see one, and take some photos.

The first thing that called my attention I would say the more insteresting part of this march is the famous gigantones.

There are giant doll-like costumed figures made of paper maché and have a hole in the middle just so the person inside of them can see where they´re going.

Those thing can get a bit heavy and are typically suported on the shoulders of the performer inside.

They often show up in pairs usually as a couple and and move according to the music played by a marching band

Often times they are satirical in natural and sometimes have been know to take the shape of monsters, demons and even celebrities/politicians.

While they are not exclusive to just Carnaval, but to other events, no Portuguese Carnaval would be complete without them.

I actually [**managed to film the pair of them in action**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv5Xg9WrBKw)

Besides Gigantones, there were some themed cars as well, but unfortunately, the place was too crowded and it was hard for me to find a good spot, but I did managed to capture a Starbucks Cup car up close after the parade had ended:

All in all it was a fun weekend, and I hope to be back for next year.
