Now that weather is a bit warmer, I´ve been hanging out at my local park lately.

It has a huge artificial lake in the middle, and it´s home to a dozen species serving as a little nature sanctuary. A good opportunity to get decent photoshoots in.

I´ve had my eye on these geese for a while, some of them I suspect were even born into the park. They´re always together never alone. And loud as hell, it´s like watching a bunch of walking bicycle horns just waddling about.

Out of curiosity I looked up some cool facts about [Geese:](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/120479-Anser-anser-domesticus)

- Domestic Geese Live around between 20 and 25 years while wild ones live up between 10 to 25;
- Can Be Raised On Grassy Pasture (as you can see them on the top photo),
- Very Social;
- Often Migrate and during their flight, the flock will take a V shape.

Also, they are able to tell each other apart, to us these three geese may look the same, but to a goose everyone is unique. Did I mention they are extremely loyal, especially among mates.

There are also a couple of these guys with a grey head, so even among domestic geese there is some color variation.

I also noticed that up close (well not so close I was using a zoom lens at a longer distance) that their beaks have serrated ends, which I guess allows to scrape grass or crush bugs.

But that´s not only thing I managed to see on that day:

[Grey herons! (*Ardea cinerea*)](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/4954-Ardea-cinerea) well a single one anyway, it´s only just one. I think this one has made its home here for like 2 or more years or it might be a different one. Its long neck and beak are perfect to capture fish, but it´s not unheard about them eating small mammals, reptiles etc....

They´re actually a migrant species, populations from more northern areas often fly south during October after the mating season but will return by February.

Hopefully, if I save up for a more powerful lens, I might capture it in more detail. And who knows I might share it here, until next time! And feel free to subscribe and comment below
