So we´re in the third week of Blaugust, so I decided to talk about a book series that I´ve been reading for these past few months: The Vampire Hunter D Light Novels and the two men involved in its creation.

## The Plot

Most people are more familiar with the animated movies. One in the 80s simply entiled Vampire Hunter D, and another in the late 90s/2000s called Bloodlust.

A lot of the stories are set in an alternative post-apocalyptic future where a nuclear war destroyed human civilization as we know it.

As a result the vampires (who are called the Nobility) came out of the shadows and took over the planet creating their own advanced society, now thousands of years have passed and those same Nobles are now on the decline and humanity once treated like servants or food are starting to return to being the dominant species once more.

However, there are still a handful of Vampires terrorizing the region, this is where the vampire hunters come in.

One such hunter is D, a half-vampire, half-human who wanders all around the Frontier offering his services.

The series is most known for its atmosphere, it feels like you´re reading a movie, (in fact I suspect it inspired a lot of anime tropes), mixing up the supernatural with sci-fi elements is a creative choice.

I would argue D as character provides some intrigue since not much is known about his past, and you often have to come with your conclusion with what little you receive as the reader. But often times I feel like he is just much as a plot device as he is a character with most of the meat of the story coming from the characters he meets in his journey and the different places he visits.

In fact there is a lot of variety in these stories, instead of just someone who hires D to hunt the undead, you don´t really know what to expect.

One plot might involved D hunting a vampire to save someone from being turned, another might have D visiting a floating city or even being hired by a noble.

In one story, no Vampire Villain showed up.

There are lot of interesting themes in this, from certain parts of the Frontier or even aspects of D himself like his manner and his wild brimmed hat were inspired by a western story, while other time you would find a lovecraftain style of narrative, there also some references to Dracula. I even managed to notice that one scene has parallels with the Bram stoker novel as D climbs down a cliff in the manner of a lizard.

All of this is of course the brainchild of  one Hideyuki Kikuchi and illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano

## Hideyuki Kikuchi

Hideyuki was born in 1949, attended  Aoyama Gakuin University and mentored by the writer Kazuo Koike.

He actually quite the prolific author, having writen about 300 books so far, and can be comapred to other authors such as Stephen King and even Clive Barker.

He is of course an horror and scif-novelist, with some of his works being translated to the west, such as the D novels and even Wicked City.

So far only 29 of the 60 D novels have been translated, and sadly this is a small fraction of his work that has been accesible to the western audience unless you go out of your way to learn Japanese.

When he created this series, he was a huge fan of the Hammer Horror Dracula movies as well as that of Captain Cronos and it shows. It was those movies that gave him the idea of creating D.

Initially he was going to make this into a pure horror series, in his own words, due to horror as a book genre not being popular at the time, he instead opted to add some some sci-fi elements. Hence why he decided to set it in the far future and even have advanced technology show up.

He really knows how to write complex themes involving horror, sexuality, humanity , the mix between the monstrous and beautiful.


## Yoshitaka Amano

Yoshitaka Amano, born in 1952, is very talended isllustrador whose career took off due to his work in Speed Racer. Yes that Speed Racer.

He eventually found success as a book illustrador, mostly known for his work in the D novels.

But he is really well knowng for creating illustration for the Final Fantasy Game series.

He even worked with western creators as well, fans of Neil game have been able to enjoy his work on Sandman, The Dream Hunters.

I find a lot of hist work breathtaking and beautiful to look at, he has a very ethereal fairy-tale like style that mixes both elements traditional japanses art with art noveu.

And it seems like he is very found of drawing beautiful characters, and it does D´s looks justify considering how handsome the character is often described.

His version of D was so popular that it became how mosts readesr imagined him in the story, to the point they even picture him with a cape.

Yes, nowhere in the novels does D ever wear a cape, instead he is often described as wearing a long coat. The cape thing is Amano´s creation, that is how powerful his illustrations were.

If you ever have the time I do recomend checking this series at your local library if you can, or if you´re lucky sometimes these are sold in book bundles.

This was indeed is a very influencial series so much so it even inpsired Japanese Popculture. For example when the developers decided to redesign Alucard for Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, they used D as inspiration.

This is what he looked like in [Castlevania 3 by the way](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/castlevania/images/9/98/CV3_J_Manual_Alucard.JPG/revision/latest?cb=20191031211710)

It´s easy to notice the similarities between the two, with both being the Half-human children of Dracula, being blessed with eternal youth and beauty, a tragic past and even somewhat similar personalities.

There has also been talks of an animated tv series in the works, know as only [Vampire Hunter D: The Series.](https://comicbook.com/anime/news/vampire-hunter-d-new-anime-update-resurrection/) It was going to have involvement from the author himself and Yoshiaki Kawajiri who also worked on bloodlust, and would adapt the other books.

Sadly, there hasn´t been any news to when it would be finally finished, leaving the state of show in a sort of limbo.

But if you like vampire fiction this is a must read, and also go check out the spin-off the Noble Greylancer who explores this universe from the prespective of the vampires.
