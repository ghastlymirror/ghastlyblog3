Boy we´re almost halfway there, till the end of August how time flies...

Now, this is where I talk about the keeping motivation part.

First things first I´m surprised I managed to get this far, I have like 15 posts already. I´ve tried to post everyday, so that one failed. Mostly because I was busy these couple of days, and felt a bit indisposed.

So, in order to not feel bad about it I decided to just be content with making as many as I could, and 15 thi months is not bad considering I typically only post once a week if my schedule allows.

And I know what you´re thinking, wow Ghastly how did you keep up with your blog? A couple of tips.

First I establish a goal, to post once a week, or every two weeks (this outside of August).

Second, I keep a document and jolt down any idea I have for an article, I might even write a light draft and decided to elaborate on later.

Also, anything can be turned into a material post if I´m creative enough. Now this one is easy I just picked one or two topics to focus on (games, my photography etc..), and just write within it.

I often write about games that I play/plan to that catch my interest, if I got out with my camera and happen to come across something interesting like a cool bug, that goes onto the blog too.

There is also the importance of taking breaks, too much of it creates burnout. It might be tempting to constantly churn out content, but that all leads to burn out.

Availability also kinda helps I guess, sometimes life gets in the way so I try to post whenever I´m free, and since this is summer I still have plenty of free time.

And the number one thing that sorta helps me getting motivated but it is not mandatory for me, was joining an online community.

It can be lonely to be on your own, but every since I joined other bloggers in this event, I got more feedbacks and more people interacting with my comments! That is nice.

Talking to other bloggers, following their blogs, and commenting on them also helps. But I have this policy of only following blogs that interest me.

See I´m way too familiar with the follow for follow, where some people will only like your stuff and follow just so you can see their blog and then quietly unfollow once they got you as a follower. Not gonna name any names or judge, but I prefer to create legitimate interactions, otherwise what is the point?

And that is my tips for staying motivated, if yall have your own personal strategies, feel free to comment.
