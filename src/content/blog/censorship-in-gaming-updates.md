Ok, so it has been a couple of days since I lasted talked about this. So here´s some good news.

The call centers for these payment companies have started to take notice, with people who contacted support reporting being asked if they´re lodging a complaint due to what is happening with Steam. So yes, Keep up with those calls guys. The key here is to take as much as their time as possible.

Also be sure to remain polite throught all of it. Remember, our anger is with the ones at the top, not at the worker who is probably not payed enough for this shit. Now, I heard some callers have been hung up immediatly, if that ever happens, you can call to complain about that stuff too, and if that doesn´t work you can contact your local and talk about having issues with getting support with your payment processor.

And of course you can also send them a physical letter, I think filling their inboxes is one other way to get their attention. If you haven´t already [this site ](https://yellat.money/)has a complete list of resources to help you do so.

Finally, and this is for those of you who who are EU citizens you can give feedback on the [Digital Fairness Act](https://archive.ph/q2Dsf). 

Meanwhile, [Itch.io has announced](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-are-seeking-out-new-payment-processors-who-are-more-comfortable-with-adult-material) it will be looking into finding new payment processors that a bit more tolerant when it comes to adult materials. Let´s hope they do succeed, and return the ability for users to search for those deindexed titles again.

As for Collective Shout who were responsbile for this whole mess, they reacted to all this pretty much as you expected. They started off by [claiming credit](https://archive.ph/USxe6) for these policies and celebrating (while sharing a tweet insulting their critics in a classy manner), only to backtrack some of that claim, saying that they did not intended for itch.io to [remove all NSFW ](https://bsky.app/profile/mrhands31.bsky.social/post/3luz3wnopws2g) only the "bad stuff", which lets be honest, they are not fooling anyone, specially when you look at [their history and actual beliefs](https://www.fujoshi.info/censorshipandconservatism#collective-shout) [**Link Warning For Quotes With Disturbing Language Involving Abuse**].

Destroying an artistic medium is a small price to pay in order to [empower their conservative beliefs](https://mimidoshima.neocities.org/main/posts/2025/collectiveshout/), it seems. 

Honestly looking at all of this, I wish I didn´t have to talk about it, there is stuff I would rather be doing right now, like enjoying my summer holiday, looking foward to this new tv show I´m watching, finish my game backlog, or heck actually make proper preparations for Blaugust which is about to happen next month.

But these people decided to not just attack a hobby that I love but also people in my own community, so I´m gonna make some noise about it.

This is it for the current updates, I really do hope all this pushback will lead to positive results. I´ll see ya in a few more days.
