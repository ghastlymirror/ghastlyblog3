## Intro

Thanks to popular shows involving the supernatural as well as certain book involving vampire romance the 2000s and even a little bit of the early 2010s were a golden age for urban fantasy, specially when trying to court a teen female demographic. Withces, vampires and even werewolves did capture the imagination. So one game studio dared to catch in on the craze with the Witches & Vampires series. 

Actually scratch, that it was actually part of the Just For Girls series published by  DTP Entertainment and delveloped by Smack Down Productions SARL, which who have several more ds games but now have moved on to the mobile gaming market, and as you will see soon is not to see why.There is also some weird things about this game, for one its was released for the Nintendo Ds and the PC (and oh boy does the PC version comes with really outdated graphics for a 2010 games, almost like they were trying to port the original console graphics.)

And that it got a sequel almost a Month Apart. My guess is that they tried to get the game out while the DS was still on its last legs.

The reason why I´m even talking about this obscure title is by accident, years ago I had this whole vampire phase (and I still do) so when I saw the game with this title, I thought I really needed to check out and at least have something to pass the time between classes and my studies, and this seemed perfect but I never finished it.

Years later I now owned a 3DS, halloween came around, and I was look for some games around this theme so I decided to finally play it to the end. (Which I did, on and off, a few months later).But was worth the nostalgia? 

And how does it hold up as a Supernatural themed Title?  Let´s find out shall we?


## The Main Story

![game screenshot showing a young woman entering a white house](/images/2025/witchesvampiresintro.jpg#original)

We get introduced to Aluna (I guess Luna wasn't mystical enough) returning to her hometown of Ashbury after 3 years. Despite coming from a long line of magic users, she wants none of that. She wants to just live a normal live without all that supernatural business.

It's here where we get introduced to her mom Valthera and two siblings, well half-siblings,  Ruby (a goth girl and half-witch), and Dariel the Vampire. But this little family reunion is interrupted by the main villain of the game Abaddon, an evil vampire who put their Mother in a magic coma.

After exploring the town and some side quests, I managed to track down Jasper, a middle-aged scholar who is the Giles of this game for you Buffy fans. He then explains how to save Mom and eventually reveals that in order to stop the bad guys, the trio must find  these elemental amulets and destroy them.


So, it's Fetch Quest: the game if I've ever seen one.

## How´s The gameplay?

This plays as your typical turn-based RPG with a couple of differences, for one, unlike other titles there isn't much in the way of recruiting characters to building your ideal party. Instead, you're stuck with the three siblings.

Each one of them plays a different RPG archetype. Ruby is the healer and as such can only do healing and stat altering spells but no offensive ones, Aluna has offensive elemental spells, and she can increase her own power as well as poison or otherwise prevent enemies from attacking.

Finally, Dariel is your tank, he is the only one who can perform a physical attack without using mana, a well as stun enemies and taunt them. He's also got some appropriate vampire named abilities such as Vampire's Kiss (which drains hit points from opponents and heals), and Undead that prevents him from dying if his health ever reaches zero, allowing players the chance to heal him in the next turn.The

also decided to incorporate a bit of the lore with the Fury ability, see in this world there are two Vampiric Factions, White and Black Vampires, which is not a very original name. Black vampires want nothing than to attack humans for their blood. And Dariel is a White vampire.

When this ability is active, it will increase his power tenfold for several turns, but on the third turn, he must drink a vampire potion, or he will turn into a Black vampire and start attacking members of your party.

While interesting in theory, I ended up not using it much, not when there is magic chalk lying around, and I focused a lot of exp points in his Magic stat. And yes, it comes up in a plot where you are sent on a quest to gather potion ingredients to control Dariel´s bloodlust.

This is also when we first get to see the touchscreen gimmick, typical for the DS era. Instead of simply pressing a button to attack, you have to draw the same pattern as shown on the screen, while novel at first, I found it tiring and there doesn´t seem to be an option to skip it.

Not to mention it's not always consistent, the game still gives some leeway if you get most of it right, but other times you could make a mistake like I did by drawing a small curve only for it to reject it.

Item use also has some limitations, you can only use them on the character you're controlling at the time, which I've had some moments where I had to choose between using my turn to attack an enemy and hope for the best, or use a healing potion and ending extending the duration of the battle.  I guess I can just use Ruby, but this forces to focus more on healing instead of stats alteration, specially in early chapters of the game before I level them enough.

Speaking of which, when it comes to the leveling system it's not made automatically, instead you´re given skill and exp points which you can distribute among your character stats at your leisure. My pet peeves is that every time you wanna upgrade your party, you must go to the family home, and tap on the small notebook upstairs.

This means I have to constantly backtrack, over and over again, while you do get to unlock fast travel, it's just not ideal. I would’ve preferred to be able to level them up through the menu.

Upgrading Abilities is also, shall we say, simplistic? You can only level them up to three levels, and there isn't a lot of them to unlock. Like seriously, I ended up still in the middle of the game with all their abilities full upgraded and plenty of skills point with nothing to use them for.

When it comes to getting items, one thing to note, is that there are no shops, so the only option is through exploration, winning battles and crafting.But I wouldn´t be too worried about running items, by the time I finished the game I still had plenty of potions and magic chalk up the wazoo.

Battle isn't the only time when the game makes ample use of the touch screen. There are up to four mini-games. No I mention crafting, which is a cooking game, is just  follow the instructions on the screen and blow on the microphone when prompted.

This one isn't so bad, since I enjoyed my fair share of cooking game. However, be prepared to do it over and over again if you need to make several potions to replenish your stock. I honestly think the developers should’ve just let make us create the same item in bulk.

And in order to get to ingredients the best way to do it is to go through the sewers as Dariel, this is yet-another mini-game you try to find mounds of dirt then clear off the touchscreen of dirt until you find the item in question. If you're lucky you might find magic chalk or whatever you need for potion making other time it's just a useless empty can, not to mention there's a time limit.

There is also at certain point in the game where the stylus is used to scry the map with a crystal constantly circling the area until it start blinking quickly leading to the next story objective or a hidden sewer entrance. I actually thought this kinda cool if not immersive, as it kinda reminds how in the Charmed TV the protagonists would use a locator spell in the same way.Good to see that trope here.

But lastly, you will eventually unlock fast travel, which is yet another mini-game where you fly on a broom and have to go through a certain number of hoops before the timer runs out. Again like some of the games mention it can be tiring very quickly when you do a lot of backtracking, the only positive thing is that it gives out extra XP, and that's it.

## Meet The characters

One could say the biggest strength in any self-respecting RPG is its cast of characters, if not the story, each. After all, you gotta give the players something that makes all that battle grind worth it, make them want to see what's going to happen next. And having characters that will stay with the player even after they finish the game, right?

You will find no such  thing here. I found most of the cast kinda bland and forgettable. I mean, Aluna only background is that she doesn't want to get involved in magic (and the story doesn't elaborate much on it), only for it to just drop that plot.

Like at this point I even almost forgot their names after I was done with this title a month ago.

The designs are also not much to write about, I think the only one that has an interesting design is Ruby, but maybe that because I'm more drawn to goth characters. Nothing about Dariel screams vampire, he looks just some dude.

Aluna is supposed to look like the everyday girl next door, but I feel like you could replace her design with another, and it wouldn't make much of a difference.

On to another topic, there is a small romance subplot in this, because no urban fantasy story could be complete without it. At one point Aluna and Company save this guy from Werewolves and cure off his curse and there is a bit of flirting. Except..

There's no chemistry, and the sprite they used for said love interest has been reused for several other NPCs, I couldn't remember his name once.

And even after helping him, the story doesn't really do much with him, he doesn't join the team or anything. On the last part of the game, he's just hiding the family home until you're done with the villain.

I guess Dariel has a subplot about his missing dad, but that kinda felt out of nowhere when you do find, and it does get resolved pretty quickly. Like, you remove this plot line without changing it much.

The only character who had anything interesting going on was Jasper, you know the Giles Expy, which is saying much. I'm saying because they took this type of character and did something with him which I did not expect. Specially considering since he's the one who's been giving the siblings advice on how to defeat the bad guy

I'm not going to spoil it here in case anyone wants to still take a crack at this game, but let's just say that I really did not see that on coming.

## Soundtrack and Setting

Soundtrack is kinda generic, with rock playing through battles and I guess you could soft pianos with electric guitars outside of it. Which keeps looping back over and over making very repetitive, that at this point as well play the game with the sound off.

Then there´s the graphics, like any typical DS title of the time, they  look  a bit outdated which can be jarring for players who are used to more modern graphics. Heck when this came out in 2010  it was already ooking behind the times since in the next year Nintendo created its handheld sucessor.

The low polygon looks kinda reminds me of a Playstation 1 one game, althought I  know some people might be into that.

Chances are this game will probably still look fine on an actual DS, but I was playing this on a 3DS XL,with its much larger screen which made some of its flaws more noticeble.

Not to mention the town the story was set in isn´t very remarkle, i mean you have the town square, the park, the cemetery and industrial central, But there´s nothing there that caugh my attention, between the lack of shops and small number of NPCS. Its makes the town feel very empty, specially when the plot mentions how this is a town with a big history. 

I mean where are the interesting landmarks? Cool statues? Something? Its just rows of empty houses and not much.

## Final Thoughts

Between the very generic Urban fantasy plot and Bland characters I don´t think this one is worth your time, unless you´re really that bored and feel some nostalgia for the DS era.

While it not without some fun stuff, I did enjoy some of the mini-games up a point as well as the plot twists. But that was not enough to compesnate for the rest of it.

I feel like this game reminds of my gripes with the whole shovelware girl games of that era. Yes, I´m aware that this a game mostly targeted at young girls done by some obscure german game company. But, heck girls deserve better. If you´re trying to introduce that demographic to the world of turn-based RPGs, this ain´t it. (That honor belongs to Rapshody: A Musical Adventure)

And as someone who did grow up watching Supernatural Shows like Charmed and Buffy, I was very dispointed, because I really did wanted to play a game that gave me that similar feel.

But if anyone is reading this and knows of games that fit that vibe, feel free to comment below.
