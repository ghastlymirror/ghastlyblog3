Sometime after [my last virtual pet review,](/blog/eternichi-tamagochi) I decided to take a look on other virtual pet games, mostly for smartphones.

Makes sense, these days almost everyone has one, plus having a virtual pet in there reminds me of the days of the keychain pet game.

So, I decided to compile this list.

There are only a couple requirements for my entries: having 2d pixel graphics, having an evolution system, play at least an homage to old pet games (think Digimon or Tamagotchi.)

## 1.Pakka Pets Village

I´m gonna start with my top favorites on this list. Pakka Pets feels a lot like an updated version of the Tamagotchi pet, due to its cute pixelated designs and game mechanics from Animal Crossing.

You get to raise a cute pet that will grow in different forms depending on how you raise it.

There´s a room to decorate and a cute village, that players can populate with their pets and customize to their tastes.

If you visit the town there are several NPCs that will ask to fulfill certain quests, which requires the use of the crafting system.

There are a couple of flaws, for one it hasn´t received updates in a while, and it's pretty much almost impossible to synchronize with your facebook account. But it still sorta functional.

While the game is not completely riddled with ads, there is one minigame (the cinema game) that requires you to watch one. The game also offers game currency in exchange for real money and even certain eggs. The game can be played without this, but keep this in mind since this game also appeals to kids.

## 2.Noa Noa


![Noa Noa Game Poster](/images/2022/noanoa.png)

A virtual pet with a twist, instead of just caring for one device pet, you care for several! You play as the employee of Noa,inc which sells creatures called noa. The point of the game is for you to raise them until they are ready to be adopted. You then receive points that you can use to decorate your avatar, and unlock designs for your devices and new locations.

This last thing is important because you will need to explore different places in order to discover new eggs. The pets themselves do not evolve, but the variety in egg types make up for it. Sometimes even the same egg will give a new species, making this game replayable. Mind you if you don´t care for your noas properly, they will die, and the game gives you bonus rewards if you managed to raise several noas in the same device in a row without them dying.

:::caution[Microtransactions]
You can buy healing items and revive your pets with real currency. While you can also get these items by watching an ad, and through regular gameplay, it can be a pain in the ass if you´re the type of player who let´s them die frequently like I did. I do also have a problem in starting a new device since it brings up the in-game store every time it happens. I don´t know if it´s a game bug, since I was able to restart it for free before, maybe they fixed it since.

## 3.Cthulhu Virtual Pet 1 and 2

If you happen to be a Lovecraft fan and always wanted have an eldritch horror as a friend, this app is for you. You get to care for it, raise to different stages (infant to godhood) dress him up, and invoke other gods to give you gifts.

And if it gets upset you can feed it a bunch of cultists. And it´s all done with cute pixelated graphics. There are also some fun minigames. For example, you have a card rpg rogue game where you fight monsters.

There two versions of this app, original and the sequel, the latter having more colorful graphics and improvements on the gameplay. A must if you like cute games with a morbid streak.


:::caution[Microtransactions]
If I can recall correctly you can unlock some skins and outfits with real money, otherwise the game is fully playable without them.

## 4.Dunpets: Dungeon Pets

![Dunpets Game poster](/images/2022/dungeonpets.jpg)
Its Tamagotchi meets Pokemon Mystery Dungeon. You play as a rescuer that navigates dungeons in search of new eggs to hatch and raise. Unlike other games, your pets evolve by leveling up instead of growing over time. You can take your pet to explore dungeons, battle monsters and find loot.

The battle system is timed, you need to tap at the right time to attack, elemental weakness also play a huge role. Besides dungeon exploring you have boss battle missions, you must defeat all the monsters in the area before unlocking the boss, and you get special rewards if you fufill certain requirements, like doing the mission without using healing items, or using a pet of certain element types etc.

However you need to feed them and give them medicine, otherwise they will die, but the game gives the option of freezing them if you´re gonna be a while without playing, which I think should an option in these kinds of games.

Like Pokemon you can also trade or send pets you don´t want to other players, there is even a random trade. But despite having several pet types, you can expand your rescue home up to 12 times, or so the game plays. I´m thinking of raising some of them to a complete adult stage before trading to complete the dunpets digipedia.

Funny enough it does have a [sequel](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.GuGamesDevelopment.DunpetsColorsPremiereDemo&hl=en&gl=US), called dunpet colors, but it downplays the virtual 90s pet aspect in favor of a more traditional pokemon game, and might still be in development.


:::caution[Microtransactions]
The game offers a pro version that offers cloud saving ( which is weird since most mobile games offer it for free), an exclusive mission, and a hard to obtain egg, that can still be obtained through normal gameplay. The good news is that it doens´t have intrusive ads, and most of these features can simply be ignored.

## 5.S.Pet


![S Pets Game Poster](/images/2022/spets.jpg)

This game used to be on the app store, but you can still play it on PC, hence why its in this list.

This a 90s virtual pet game at it´s most basic, you adopt and care for a pet, and it will grow in real-time. It can take different forms according to its life change, and you can unlock different family lines.

The gameplay is a bit simplistic when compared to the ones that I just mentioned. But´s it great for those with busy lives, and it´s not a very demanding pet. 

True to form you can download a game manual, its explains the basic and comes with cute hand-drawn art, that reminds me of virtual pet games of old


:::caution[Microtransactions]
This is a full free to play indie game. However, you can support the creator through the itch.io page and pay whatever you want.
