It´s been a while since I shared some great photos. This time around without having to leave the house! I saw this little guy on one of my flowers and took my macro lenses out.

I suspect this is a [cricket-bat orbweaver](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/319548-Mangora-acalypha) judging by the pattern. There isn´t a lot of information currently about them, except for the fact they can be found in meadows or gardens.

Orbweavers are from Araneidae family and a common variety of garden spiders, called that for their circular bodies.

Also builders of spiral wheel-shaped webs. As you can see here in my attempt to take a photo of it.

Funny thing this spider lived in my mini-garden if you can call it that for a month, before disappearing to God knows where. it would often create a web on one plant, then remove said web, and then show up on another plant.

It wasn´t easy taking photos with this lens, as it would often get too dark, but I managed to capture the details. I do love its pattern, it feels like some decided to paint a geometric pattern on a tiny orb.

And I can even see its hairs. There are actually serve as a type of sensory organ that helps the spider feel movement and detect its prey. This is a bonus for me, at least I have something that will take care of garden pests for me.

So, here are my first attempts at macro, I know its not perfect but its a start. And I hope to improve over time.
