## Video Summary

This a playlist of my completed walkthrough of Anna´s Quest, a point and click adventure with a fairy tale theme.

The story involves a young girl being kidnapped by a witch, and she must escape with the help of her teddy bear companion. Meanwhile, her grandpa is sick and needs a cure.

It´s cute and has it moments, and it´s relatively short, so a nice game to play a lazy afternoon.

I might plan on writing on small review for it soon. So, for now please enjoy this playthrough.
