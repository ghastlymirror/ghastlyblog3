It´s been a while since I last [wrote about this game](/blog/longing-review), I figured I might as well write a small guide since I´m aware that some people may find the idea of taking 400 days to finish this game daunting or are at a loss what to do.

So here´s my insight on how best to go through it, that will enhance your game experience and perhaps encourage the fence-sitters to give it a try.

I will try my best to keep it spoiler-free.

## 1.Time Manipulation

Again the concept of this game is that you have to wait 400 days for the king to wake up, and time still moves on when you are not playing.

I know what you´re thinking, 400 days? I don´t have the patience to play that long! Fear not, cause there are plenty of ways to accelerate time ingame.

You can do it by expanding and decorating your home, reading, eating pink mushrooms and sleeping in your bed ( if you build one). Reading, in particular, can be done manually or idling, but time accelerating only works once for each page you´ve read.

If you run out of books to read, there is always the neverending notebook. You can add pages to it by editing the game files. Get creative! Use it as your personal diary, write a story, use it as personal game notes... I even added the entire Dracula novel, don´t ask.

Another trick is if you click on the hourglass several times it will give you the option to slow or make time go faster. If you put in slow you can click again to return to the default state. But this method only works on a fully expanded cave.

There is however one place where time stands still: The Halls of Eternity. If you´re not interested in pausing the game, be sure to leave the place before turning the game off.

And last but not least, if you need to reverse time, you can create a blue fire and read books in reverse.

## 2.Get A Map


![A bunch of carvings in the wall looking like a map of the entire cave](/images/2022/thelongingmapcarvings.jpg#center)


The cave is huge and maze-like, making it easy for you to get lost. And unlike other games it does not come with an easy-to-access map with the click of a button.

The best way to get around is to draw your own map on paper as you explore, so you have a clear idea of where to go.

But if you´re lazy like me, you can find a map in this certain area. It´s on the upper side of the caves, hard to miss it. Get the Shade to investigate it and wait. It should slowly zoom out showing the entire area. I screenshotted it so I could always have it with me without having to go back there again, saving me some time.

## 3.Enter the Halls Of Eternity

If you explore the cave more thoroughly you may come across this huge white room with nothing but white columns that seems to stretch on forever. Like I mentioned earlier, time completely stops here. But if you walk long enough there are a bunch of goodies to be found to take with you to your home. Also, it´s a great place to get more paper for your drawing should you run out. ( I would advise listening to some music or a nice podcast while doing this)

Feel free to walk for a long as you like, just remember, it will take you the same amount of time to return for how long you´ve been traveling the hall.

## 4.Mattocks, gotta catch them all.

The noble mattock is the most important tool you will ever need to explore the cave. You can use it to mine resources, expand your home, and unlock certain areas. There are about 4 of them, the first one is easy to find (hint it takes 2 weeks to access it). Two can be found near the surface, and another in the mines ( you will have to figure out how to break in though, hint: check for where the support is the weakest).

Now a bit of a warning, there is a glass wall with treasure behind it. You might be tempted to break it, don´t. I made the mistake then found myself stuck without my first mattock, took me a while to figure how to get another.

Instead, wait till you have three or all of them before trying it.

## 5.Ending the Game Early


![A screenshot with the words the Longing has Ended](/images/2022/thelongingending.jpg#center "The End?")


This is for the more impatient players out there, you will be happy to know that waiting 400 days isn´t the only way to end the game, being the main ending.

However, the game does give you the option of disobeying the King and find your own path.

There are in total 5 endings you can get. When this game was first release you wouls only be stuck with the one you got never be able to play the game again without some files modification.
But there has been updates ever since so you are free to replay the game and try to get all of them for those who you who are  completionists.

And Yes, you can find the exit to the cave if you explore the cave completely ( think in which direction a cave entrance would really be) If you´re worried about accidentally activating this ending if you get near the surface, don´t. All of the endings require an active method to get to them, and in one ending you are given the warning that it will end the game.

But if you really wanna know which ending to get or what steps to take, there is a character called the face that will tell you what happens in each ending and a couple of clues to solve it, for a price. The Shade will sometimes even write notes on the last page of the book, so it´s important to play attention to the dialogue.

Now, there is an ultra-special ending, this one is harder to achieve especially on your first playthrough, requiring certain timed events. If you paid any attention to my entry about time manipulation, this should make things easier. Ask the face to tell you a secret, and they will give you three clues.

## 6.Completing Objectives


![A menu showing books you can read and game objectives](/images/2022/longingobjectives.jpg#center)


Lost on what to do first? The thoughts book has a couple of objectives for you to do. They´re mostly optional, but do aid in the progress of the game. New information is also added or scribbled over as you find new things in the game.

## 7.The art tells a Story

")


This is not essential to complete the game but a fun little trivia I found. If you look closely, some of the paintings you make have interesting names, they give hints to things you might find in the game or the plot itself. You can mix different colors to get make them. It´s how I managed to decide what ending I really wanted. Although I would like to know the reasoning of the clown painting, just why?



![A Book Page Shwoing a Poem](/images/2022/longingreading.jpg#center)



Then there are the books, all these are in the public domain by the way and can be found on the Gutenberg project. Some of them have themes related to the game, and while you don´t have to sort through them all, it´s a neat way to make you reflect about the game is trying to tell you.

I mean one of the poems I read refers to an Underground King that promises to end all longing, which is what this game took inspiration from.

## 8.Celebrate the Shade´s Birthday

So, by now some time has passed getting closer to the 400 days mark. You may have read the Shade mentioning their birthday is near that. And perhaps something special happens that day according to the face.

But when is it? Well, if you paid attention to the opening of the game it should give you a clue.

Still stuck? Well, remember how many days there are in a regular year then calculate it with the 400 days, that should give you an estimate of when to open the game.

Get that little Shade their present, they sure deserve it for all that waiting. But if you missed that event you can always reverse time. Lapis lazuli will appear on the giant crystal pool area letting you try again.

There it is all my tips, hope this make playing the game less confusing.
