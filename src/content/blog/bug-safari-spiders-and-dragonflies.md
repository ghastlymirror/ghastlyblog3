One of the groups of animals I found fascinating are insects and of course arachnids. Not only are they the most diverse and biggest (in terms of population) groups of animals. Vertebrates, on the other hand, represent a small fraction of life on Earth.

They came in a variety of forms and feeding habits. Despite being the most misunderstood of animals, they an extremely important role in our ecosystem, as pollinators, in decomposition, and even population control of other invertebrates.

And since they are everywhere, you don´t need to go long distances to see them. You can even see them in an urban setting if you pay enough attention...

So here are some of the ones I caught photos of over the years.

## 1. Cross Spider

The cross spider (*Araneus diadematus*)[^1], is a variety of garden orb spider. It was called because of the beautiful cross pattern on it´s back. They can be mostly found in Western Europe as well some parts of the US and can prefer places like wood areas, gardens among others. And typically the females are the ones who make webs.

As you can see in this photo, I suspect this is a female due to its size and shape. Males are smaller. And what luck, she was in the middle of feeding on a wasp when I found her.

## 2.Blue emperor

Unless I´m mistaken this is a blue emperor (*Anax imperator*), and a female one at that, since females tend to be mostly green, while on males they only have green thorax and eyes, with the rest of them having a striking almost electric blue color.

Also they´re basically apex predators, not only do they hunt for butterflies and tadpoles, and even other members of the Odonata order[^2]

Speaking of which, Dragonflies are known for being one of the best fliers in the insect world. Not only do they have the capacity for flying in different directions thanks to the structure of the wings, but they are also really fast. Having sharp eyesight with their compound eyes also helps. Which makes them the hardest subject to capture. This one was standing still, so I wasted no time.

They have both a water nymph stage and an adult flight stage. The best place to find them is near water, like river streams, even garden ponds.

## 3.Common Pill Woodlouse


![a small black pillbug](/images/2022/blackpillbug.jpg)

The pill bug, rollie-polly, woodlice, potato bugs, or whatever you like to call them contrary to common knowledge. They are not insects (although you could argue that [insects are an offshoot of crustaceans](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08742)), classified as Isopods, this group is an order of crustaceans. Both can be found in the ocean, fresh water and on land. With the marine ones known to grow to gigantic sizes! Land dwellings ones however are can´t get that big.

This one I saw is a called a common-pill bug (*Armadillidium vulgare*)[^3], which is a very common species. They are known to roll up in a ball to protect themselves. A lot of people find them cute because of this. They feed on decaying plant matter, old wood, algae, and lichens. [You can even keep them as pets,](https://www.neherpetoculture.com/isopodcare) and they are very easy to maintain.

This little guy was actually outside my door, the white wall was an ideal background to accentuate its dark color.

## 3.Palm Tree Weevil

This photo is really old, so forgive the quality. What you see here is a Palm weevil (*Rhynchophorus ferrugineus*) Unlike my previous entries, this is not a native species to Europe, but an invasive one. It was brought here through the exportation of Palms trees, and it´s considered a pest since it can cause a lot of devastation. This is a shame, since I found its bright red color and long snot attractive. They usually lay their eggs in the bark, and then the larva burrows and start eating away the wood.

They originate from tropical Asia, I´ve read the larvae are considered quite a delicacy in some other countries. Hey, I´m not judging, it´s not that different from us westerners being into shrimp, and as I mentioned insects are sorta related to crustaceans so...

Funny enough, I did not need to even go out to find it. It was by my window. Someone left a glass of leftover coconut water by accident, which was probably attracted it. It flew before I could grab it.

## 4.Long-Horned beetle

I´m still not sure of the exact species, (a *Ergates faber*, probably)[^4] but what I do know it is a long-horned beetle which belongs to the **Cerambycidae** family. Their larvae are known to burrow in wood. It is widespread in several countries in Europe, and also in some areas in North Africa like Algeria and Tunisia. Long-horns are known for their long antenna and elongated bodies and can come in a variety of colors.

Some can be considered pests known to attack wood structures on homes, while others such as this individual in the photo, are considered vulnerable and require conservation efforts.

Also this one is native to Europe.

## Thats it For now

So, I hope you all enjoy my photos and learn a little bit more about this group of animals.
