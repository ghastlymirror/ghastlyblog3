I previously made a small mention of this game In my Summer gaming post. If you haven´t read already, I´ve talked about how I like insects.
So months ago, when someone showed up with a Demo about a game that was exactly about that and a virtual pet game to boot I had to check it out.


## Story and Gameplay

You get to play as a scientist trying to restore a forest destroyed by a fire. After stealing away a couple of eggs from a lab and taking refuge in a small cabin in the woods, its your life´s mission to raise the bugs who will return the place to its former glory.

So, at the start of the game I only had a single egg to raise (but you can raise up to three at the same time), a rubber ducky isopod to be exact, and yes it is exactly as adorable as it sounds. I named mine Daffy.

Gameplay is pretty standard as far as most virtual pet simulators go. You feed it, you play with it, make sure it gets a good night sleep.

You can even decorate its terrarium and give it a fun little hat!

However, what is not so simple is that in order to progress through the story you have to raise bugs that fit some requirements, from being a specific species to having certain personality traits.

While its not that hard it took me a couple of tries to raise the right bug. That being said, the game is helpful in giving some hints about how to raise those stats.

It can be determined to how much you play with it, what food you give them and how you decorate.

Speaking of traits, when they hatch, they are born with a specific tarot card attached, these can give some game bonuses, like your food being free or you can even get a Shiny pet, just like in pokemon. Of course if you don´t like the card you can just pay to get a new random card.

And by the way the in-game currency? Bug Poop, no really. Its can be gathered by cleaning their mess, but also by playing games. Each bug has at least three minigames exculsive to their own species. They´re very simple arcade games. My first bug had me playing plinko. But I´ve been partial to playing green light, red light, which has a bug trying to get to the finishing line without getting caught by robotic birds.

After bonding with my little friend, getting enough money and then checking out the in-game store to unlock new furniture and mess around with the gatchapon machine that occasionally gave out facts about bugs, I decided to check out how my little budy is doing... only to find out its dead.

Which is something that as the proud owner of a tamagotchi, is something that I´m all too familiar with. But as a sad as it was to see little Daffy and its sucessors go, its also an important of its life cycle, because then its eggs can will get released into forests and I get to keep them in order to raise a new bug, and eventually I got to unlock new species to raise.

I`m also given two options to pay my last respects. I can either go for the more scientific route and preserve them by pining them and put them a certain pose, or go for the more traditional route and simply bury them in the garden with a small tombstone.

Both options though, do allow me to write my own epithet and I get to see the photos I took of them during their life. Sadly you can only have up to three photos in your album.

But the most important question here is, can you pet the bug? And yes you can pet the bug, make it into a total cuddlebug if you want, just be careful where to you pet, it´s sensitive. Which is something I wish I could in real life, but thanksfully its here.

Keep in mind, this is an idle game so there is a lot of waiting around while these little critters grow, most of the time I would have the game running in the background, while I would be watching a youtube video or something, only to come check it occasionally if my pet needed something.

While the game has a lot of focus in creating a bond with whatever bug you´re raising, I feel like I only formed an attachment with the first ones that I hatched, its like at a certain point I was raising the bugs justfor the sake of completing the story, which I know, its pretty much the point of the game.

But usually when I play these type of games there´s gotta be at least some form of affection, of course may that´s just me. But yeah, I´m not gonna lie, it felt like I was going throught a bit of slog at a certain point, and there´s so many times you can play the same minigames, you know?

Not that I didn´t have fun raising them, I did like putting them in cute hats, come up with fun names, and of course took as many screen shots as I could.

What I´m saying here is, this is probably a game best played in short bursts. It´s also a short game, I think it took me about 17 hours to finish it not, including any achievements.

My one complaint is that I wish there were more species to raise, I think It would´ve been cool to raise a dragonfly, or a milipede. But I´m guessing there was a specific reason why only this species were chosen, and not the others.

Or at least, once you finished the main story mode, it would unlock some new eggs, and the main objective would be to help repopulate the bug population, get more polinators in there.

## Design and Writting

![a human hand holding a purple flower](/images/2025/bughandflower.png)

The devs cleary went with Pixelart for this one, that is by design. It does give a very retro feel to it, which is what gives this game its charm, made even more obvious with part of the GUI resembling an handheld, you can even unlock new skins for its.

Not only that but the art did a good job making the bugs themselves look cute while keeping them realistic. Of course, I always found the real version of them cute, but  between their big cute eyes or their colorful appearance, I think might have some appeal even to the people who dislike creepy crawlies.

Ok, so outside the whole taking care of a virtual pet thing, turns  out there´s a whole story. To be honest? I didn´t find it all that memorable, you see throught the protagonist´s letter and diary entries, talking about their relationship with another scientist, why they are doing this, about their misgivings or feeling about their project, plus a bit of backstory about corporate saboutage..

I mean its not a bad story by all means, and can give something to think about, but it didn´t matter all that much to me compared to the rest of the game.

Althought, I did like the educational aspect where you collect bug facts, not just about the pets you´ve been raising, but other species in general.

There should be more games out there to do this sort of thing, since I´m from that era where educational computer games where a big thing, and happy to see that that tradition is still going on. Funny enough, the game that make be interested in insects in the first place was [the Bug´s Life Activity Center](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_wB87iFxUY), I remember there was a mode where you took photos of the bugs in the screen, and collected their entry in an album that showed facts about them.

I guess congratulations are in order for the devs who made a title that felt like a call back to that.

## Final Thoughts

All in all, this is a pretty interesting game to play if you´re into pet raising sims with a more realisitc flair. Between the cute bug designs, customzing and even learning about them, there is something here to keep me entertained for some time.

It is though, as I´ve mentioned earlier, this is not the type of game to play in one go, but more to play for a couple of minutes or the course of several days.

Chances are I´m had this one to my list of Bug Themed Games to play. Its not all that expensive as you can get for a couple of bucks, althoguht I did bought when Steam was doing A creature collector game sale, so you are gonna get your money´s worht here.
