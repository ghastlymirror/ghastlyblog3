We´re now almost halfway through Blaugust, this week´s theme is appreciation for creators or things that you love, which is kinda hard for me to decide.  
There are just so many, so I decided to make a list.

:::note
Due to the recent controversies surrounding the author Neil Gaiman, his entry has been removed from this article

## 1.Junji ito

When it comes to horror manga, no one can top Junji Ito, for his disturbing but oftentimes time detailed/ and even beautiful art.  
Also, he is not afraid to take risks and make horror out of even the most ridiculous concepts…  
A shark with mechanical legs? Being driven by the urge to enter a hole? Spiral? The sky´s the limit.  
He has a sense of humor about it too, at one point he even made a cat diary using the same creepy art style for his regular works. lol that's Ito for ya.


## 2.True Facts About...Youtube Series

A very informative and frankly really hilarious series of videos about animals.  
It narrates detailed facts about the species in question in a typical documentary style, the narrator can pull a mean Morgan Freeman impersonation.  
I ´ve learned a lot, I recommend people to give it a watch.

## 3.The Disney Trinity of Shows

I´m not talking not just one but three shows, that was Jumpstarted by Gravity Falls, these shows aren´t afraid of dealing with dark topics while still maintaining it´s mostly lighthearted nature.

If you like horror mysteries/or conspiracies is the show for you. A pair of twins have to Stay for the Summer with Their Grunkle of Stan and find a mysterious journal.

If Fantasy is more of your ally I recommend the Owl House or if you are more of a biology nerd Amphibia.  
While both shows deal with a plucky protagonist who ends up in another world, they could be more different.  
The owl house seems more inspired by typical fantasy tropes and the works of Bosch if they had a baby together, while the second show involves a world populated by giant talking frogs and insects.

## 4.Inside Job

Alexy Hirsch the same dude behind gravity falls has worked on this as well as another creator, Shion Takeuchi.  
I would have described it as if someone decided to make an SCP tv show in the same style of Alex´s previous work with some Rick and Morty inspiration in the mix.  

That being said I kinda liked it better than the famous adult swim shows.  

The basic premise is about this scientist who works for a company that is responsible for almost every single conspiracy theory you can think of, think lizard people the Illuminati you name it.  
Had a ton of moments that made me laugh, also includes some fun social commentary and even decent character development.

## Final Thoughts

And here are all my favorite works and creators so far, I would´ve added a lot more, but if I did my list would be too long and take forever to write.

Feel Free to talk about your favorite stuff below
