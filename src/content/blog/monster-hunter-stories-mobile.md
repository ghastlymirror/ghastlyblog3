Here I am with yet another review, this time involving a spinoff of The Monster Hunter series. Unlike other games in this franchise, Stories has different gameplay more akin to Pokemon than a monster hunting game where you can befriend and tame monsters.

This game has been out a while now and was initially published for the 3DS, so imagine my surprise when I found it available for mobile phones. However, it is one of the more expensive games in the store being like 20 bucks or something, being a port of a AAA.

But is it worth the price? Let´s see.

## The Plot

Unlike other games, this time around you will be playing a Rider instead of a Hunter. Riders befriend and tame monsters instead of merely hunting and use an object called the Kinship Ore that gives them the ability to bond with other creatures.

The game starts when the main character and their two friends, Cheval and Lilia look for a monster egg. After succeeding in hatching it and taming an adorable dragon monster right away and without even using the ore, the three friends return to the village only for it to be attacked by a rampaging Nargacuga that has been possessed by something called the Black Blight, causing death in destruction in its wake.

A year passes and the main character is then initiated as a full-fledged rider and it´s up to them to investigate the Black Blight that has been plaguing the land and making all the monsters Berserk and put a stop to it.

## The Controls

Right off the bat, I was pleased that the version plays pretty much the same as the original version, you get the same story, same gameplay, and no micro-transactions. This makes it a good alternative for those who don´t own the console, and since Nintendo has moved on to the Switch, one can hope we might see more ports of older games.

All the controls have been optimized for the touchscreen. You touch the left side to move your character in whatever direction, and slide on the right side to move the camera, and have buttons that will prompt you to talk or to interact with the environment, as well as other touchable icons. You also have the option to attach a controller.

Unfortunately, there is no way to change the position of the controls, but it does play comfortably at least in my experience.

Another new feature is the auto-save, while I would prefer a save system that allows at least to save my progress whenever I want without having to travel to the save-point, this at least prevents the complete loss of game progress. The graphics have been improved compared to the 3DS version and are nice to look at, it feels like I´m playing an actual console game instead of less than stellar graphics.

However, it might require a decent phone to play, I played this on a Xiaomi 10T, and it runs pretty well, with no lags or glitches. Fortunately, you can adjust your graphics so it won´t eat up your phone´s battery so much.

## Combat

While previous games have an action RPG game style, this one takes a more turn-based approach with some twists.

For example, there are no random encounters, to initiate combat you must approach a monster, or you easily avoid it if you don´t want combat by avoiding enemies.

If you approach it from behind you can even initiate the attacks first, but if a monster sneaks up behind they´re the ones that get an extra attack. So, being aware of your surroundings is key here.

Now, there´s a couple of options here, the main attacks work in a rock-paper-scissors type. Power attacks beat Technical attacks, and Technical beats Speed, and so on.

When you go head to toe, a couple of things can happen if your attack beats another type you can cause damage, if it´s a draw you both receive and get dmg, if their attack beats yours, you´re the only one who gets hurt.

Each enemy has its pattern of attack, so it´s important to figure out the correct type to use.

Another thing to consider is that you can´t only control your mons, just your character. Each monster you tame has its preferred attack. However, you can suggest certain special moves, and as a bonus, if both you and your mons use the same attack type, it activates a Double Attack more powerful than a regular one and prevents the enemy from attacking.

You can also access special moves that debuff or buff certain stats, and certain items.

During combat, you can fill up the meter in the Kinship stone, once it´s filled up you get the option to ride your mons. Should you succeed in using the right attack types, your kinship level increases, and once it´s high enough you can then activate the Special attack, which ends the Ride mode.

## Exploring the World

You are given an open world to explore as well its many secrets. While you're out in the fields besides monsters hunting, you can scavenge for crafting materials, mine, fish catch bugs, find nest eggs, and chest that can give you items.

There´s also a bunch of pig-like creatures hidden throughout the game, if you talk to them you can find them at the stable, and even get special rewards.

I think the fun part is that you can ride your monster besides just walking, I haven´t gone that far but I assume certain monsters allow you to fly or swim in certain areas.

Besides the main story, you can complete side-quests, called subquests. You can do so by talking to villagers and use the quest board. They range from collecting, crafting materials, to hunt certain monsters and even showing off certain eggs.

They´re optional but completing them is worth it since it gives both experiences points, currency, recipes, and other items.

## Crafting and Customization

Like a typical RPG the main character is highly customizable. After playing through the opening scene you can choose the gender of your rider, name, as well as a couple of face and hairstyle options, you can also change your appearance at any time in your home (except for gender) and can even change the colors of your weapons and armor. There is also an option to change the outfit of Navirou, your guide and companion.

You have the option of choosing between four weapons types, each with unique skills depending on the equipment you´re wearing.

If you manage to get a hold on crafting materials you can combine them to create items, of course, this requires recipes. Materials like ore or hides can also be used to refine weapons and amour improving their level and unlocking new skills.

## Taming Monsters

While this is a mons game, this ain´t Pokemon. Instead of capturing monsters in combat, you will have to find a nest, and take the egg. However, you must do so before the parent shows up, and can only carry one egg at a time.

Then the egg is hatched at the stables by tapping on it. The location where you touched it will determine its basic stats, as a bonus you can also customize the skills of your monster with the Rite of Channeling, where you can transfer genes into a slot to awaken certain abilities, you can adjust your own playstyle through this.

But, you can only have up to four monsters in your party, the rest will live at the stable, and can choose one of them to be your main mount.

## Game Rating

I´m glad that this is a decent port, with comfortable controls and even better colorful graphics, without even watering down from the original game

Its taming system, character customization make it stand out from other monster games of the same genre and works as a spinoff, and is sure to give several hours of entertainment.

While the game´s story is long, it has an interesting plot. So, much o, that they made an anime adaptation based on the game.

There isn´t much that I can complain about this game, except for the multiplayer system. You used to be able to battle other players but at the time of this writing, the network system has been shut down, so you can only enjoy the game in single-player off-line mode.

So, why it is expensive for a mobile app, it´s worth checking out, there are no ads, no micro-transactions, you get exactly what you pay for, a fully complete game. But if it´s still too much you can always wait for sales.
