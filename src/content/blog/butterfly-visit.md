## Video Summary

This take several months ago, but only now I got the motivation to upload it.

What happened was one January morning I heard the sound of beating wings against the window, only to found this little fella.

All I know it got in because someone had another window open and its was probably attracted by all the flowers in the house.

For the curious it is called an European Peacock, and itÂ´s typically a garden butterfly in europe.
