Another year has passed and since we´re near the end of 2024, and one thing I like to do is do a full review on how I did tackling the dreaded backlog. 

First thing first i did a little checkup on the good ol steam replay.

## Steam

![Steam relay 2024, 8 achivements, 28 play sessions, 3 new games](/images/2024/steamreplay2024.png)

As you can see I haven´t done a lot of gaming on Steam, only to play Lord of The Rings online and every once in a while Play that brand new Webfishing game. Gravekeeper I had installed it for halloween but never bothered to open the game, and as for Portal?
I for the life of me don´t know How it got there since I dont recall installing it.

Instead most of gaming sessions were outside of steam, with retro games and my 3DS console. I dunno why regardless how many modern games I´ve already bought i seem to always flock to old classics.

So below here´s a complete list of games I´ve played this year per platform.

## Nintendo
- (3DS) **Yokai Watch**
- (3DS) **GTP7** which is a cool Mario Kart 7 mod
- (3DS) **Luigi´s Mansion**
- (3DS) **Tomodachi Life**
- (3DS) **Fantasy Life**
- (3DS) **Rythm Heaven Megamix**
- (DS) **A Witch´s Tale**
- (DS) **Coraline**
- (DS) **Elite Beat Agents**
- (GBA) **Pokemon Pinball**
- (GBA) **Pokemon Mystery Dungeon**
- (GBA) **Pokemon Seaglass** which is a very cool romhack based on Pokemon Emerald
- (GBA) **The Nightmare Before Christmas: Rise of the Pumpkin King**
- (GameCube) **Animal Crossing**
- (WiiU) **Splatoon**
- (WiiU) **Mario Kart 8**
- (Switch) **Animal Crossing Horizons**

In restropective most of these are games that don´t really have an ending and I ended up picking up every once in a while. I´m still playing the first Animal Crossing game, this one i took a break for several months then decided to get back again one I found how the Dolphin emulator has integrated Retroachivements.

This also mark the very first time I got to play Splatoon, I did on the Cemu emulator and thanks to a kind soul, they helped me set up the necessary files that would allow me to play on Multiplayer mode on the Pretendo Server.

I think the only game I finished was Coraline, and it was actually an interesting game despiste being a Movie license, I would recomend people giving this one a try.

## PC
- **Dreamlight Valley**
- **Shin Chan Me and the Professor on Summer Vacation**
- **Grim Fandango**
- **Discworld 2: Mortality Bytes**
- **101 Dalmatians: Escape from Devil Manor**


Out of all these Discworld 2 and the 101 Dalmations game were completed. I liked them as far 90s adventure games go, with Discworld being the funniest, and Dalmations had a great spook vibe for a kids game.
I´m still trying to work on finishing Grim, but I seem stuck at a puzzle plus something happend with screerecording app I was using so its abadoned until further notice, and I did spent a huge chunk of the summer with the Shin Chan game which is kinda fitting, and it is a very chill and adorable game.

Dreamlight Valley played for a while, I might get back into once I get the next update.

## Playstation 2
- **Piglet´s Big Game**
- **Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie´s Revenge**

I barely started with Nightmare, so I might as a well focus on Piglet´s Big Game. I played this one out of curiosity due to viral comparisons with Silent Hill and Resident Hill, but for a more younger audience.

I´ve been enjoying it so far, playing the first two levels I haven´t find it that scary excpet for that room where I fought the first boss, but i guess it can be very unsettling for younger children.

When I`m done with it, maybe I might post my thoughts on it here.

## In Review
I would say this has been a very productive year when it comes to gaming, althought I confess at times it feels like I´m better at starting games then finishing them. Hopefully I migh complete them next year.
