Another Year, another Blaugust am I right?

For those who you who are new, Blaugust is a organized anually event for the blogging community, in August bloggers are given a challenge to makes as many posts as they can, with some writing prompts during the event. And you get a badge to share on your blog for bragging rights. cool right?

The main objective is to get people into  more traditional forms of blogging, plus you get to part of a thriving online community, discover some sites to read. And I would argue, an alterntive to just staying stuck on social media. Speciall where there so much cool stuff out there.

This bring to me to news about this years event. Normally this event is lead by [Belghast,](https://aggronaut.com/2025/07/11/blaugust-in-another-castle/), but due to some personal issues has passed the torch to Krikketin her [announcement post](https://nerdgirlthoughts.game.blog/2025/07/10/blaugust-2025-is-coming/) owner of Tales from The Aggronaut, along with details on how to join.

Also I would like to declare that my Blog will be participating this time around, after being absent last August. I had a couple of reasons for this, as I´ve probably mentioned on here several times. Due to my issues with Worpress.com, I was trying to figure a plan on how to transfer my blog, which went into a rabbit hole of how to use a static site generator as well as getting my own personal domain.

But it took me so long so I missed out.

And for those who knew me from my previous years of participation, hi. You may have known my blog as The Ghastly Gamer, if you wondering the change of layput or the Blog name this is why. And if you haven´t updated my link in your blogroll/rss feed, this is your reminder to do so.

Anyway I can´t wait to interact with you all and read some of the stuff you´ll write, and put my blogging muscles to good use.

See ya in August!
