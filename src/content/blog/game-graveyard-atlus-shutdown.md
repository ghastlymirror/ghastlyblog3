Months ago I mentioned [a series of dead mmos](/blog/dead-mmorpgs) brought back thanks to the preservation efforts of fans.

Imagine my disapointment when I found one of them ( Shin Megami Tensei Re:Imagine) was shutdown by atlus.

For who don´t know, Shin Megami Tensei: Imagine was an MMO based off its [most famous franchise.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei_(video_game))

The game was released in 2007 only to eventually have an international release.

And I gotta say, I was impressed at the time on how different it was since it really stood out among the generic fantasy online that were very popular at the time.

You played a demon tamer of sorts in an apocalyptic future, and could collect a variety of demons. This game had somewhat of a cult following until it was shutdown completly in 2016.

About four years later, a bunch of fans brought it back, allowing people the joy of being able to keep playing the game.

Funny enough it was based on the Japanese version, with a huge translation effort put into it.


This was shortlived because Atlus decided it was infringing their own copyright and sued, despite having no plans whatsoever to ever bring it back and forcing the creator of said project to terminate it.

Better informed people than me [can give you the details](https://www.eurogamer.net/atlus-sues-fans-behind-shin-megami-tensei-mmo-recreation)

Thank you accursed farms, you are a voice of reason in these dark times


So yeah, preservation of dead online games is illegal apparently. To be fair, I´m not exactly shocked since game emulation was always in that sort of gray area.

But its understandable why I feel sad about this, no angry by this.

Time and time again game corporations insist in treating games as just an expendable product, to be discarded away once it is no longer profitable.


And they aren´t willing to make it opensource or anything, they still keep the rights to said software even if it just sits there accumulating dust.

Wanna try to keep that game alive? Well screw you, and it doesnt matter if you aren´t making money out of this.

I´m so tired.

The only silver lining on this is that the emulation project has now [been made opensource,](https://archive.org/details/smt-develop) so other people could take up the project´s legacy and take a crack at it.

Just try not to draw much attention to this when you do. Because remember, Big Brother Altus is always watching.
