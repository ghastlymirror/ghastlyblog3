If you were a kid during the 2000s, there are two Disney online games that were all the rage, the first one is club penguin, the second was Toontown. Both have since been taken offline, only living the memories of their players.

The good news is not all is lost as a group of gamers have managed to bring it back to life, allowing me to review this classic.

I´ve already mentioned this game in a [**previous post,**](/blog/dead-mmorpgs) but I´ve since decided to expand on that


## A New Star is Born

")

So a little bit of history, ToonTown was officially launched on June 2, 2003 and could be described as a subscription-based MMORPG created by Disney Interactive, which gave the players a chance to create their own cartoon characters and interact with beloved Disney characters such as Mickey and Donald.

The concept itself was inspired by Roger Rabbit, in which you could explore a town populated by cartoon characters living peacefully together with a style that was reminiscent of old cartoons. The graphics were colorful, and despite the simplicity of the gameplay, it was interesting enough to capture the attention of a young audience.

And in order to create some conflict within the game, players were expected to fight enemies called Cogs that resemble robotic businessmen, whose main objective was to conquer all of ToonTown and replace the buildings with Corporate Skyscrapers.

But all good things must come to an end with servers being shut in 2013 and the game being made free to play in its last moments as its last hurrah.

Thanks to fan preservation efforts the game was brought back under the title of Toontown Rewritten.

## Taking a Stroll Through ToonTown

![game character creator](/images/2022/createatoon.jpg#center)


When I first logged on, I was taken to build-a-cartoon mode. There are several animal species to choose from, like cats, dogs, ducks, deers, mice, alligators, etc...Then you have body type, color, pick an outfit and gender..... which only consists of whether or not your toons have eyelashes.

Toon names can also be created by picking a set of default names and mix them together, if a player wants a name outside the list they gonna have to wait for it to be approved.

Once was satisfied with my choices I created a purple deer called Baron Thunderson, seems like a cool name.


![a purple cartoon deer saying hi](/images/2022/toonplayer.jpg#center "Meet The Baron")


Once in I got introduced to the main game mechanics, called here a Toontorial (this game is filled with a ton of puns get used to it) it´s decent way to introduce new players, before being able to join the main hub.

After all that the first area I got to see to is a playground in Toontown Central, one of six basic neighborhoods.

Playgrounds are safe areas where toons can just relax and socialize, receive quests, and play a variety of minigames.


![the toontown city](/images/2022/toonplayground.jpg#center "What a nice neighbourhood")


These minigames come in three types, first, there´s the fishing minigame, where you simply click and use a power meter to throw the bait, and then sell the fish for beans the main currency, and there´s also a fish encyclopedia where you can see all the species you´ve caught so far.

The second type is the trolley games, this is how I´ve earned most of the beans in this game.


![A purple cartoon deer fishing on a pond](/images/2022/toonfishing.jpg#center "Every Online Game Must have Fishing, it´s the law.")


These games can be played alone or with other players. Some of the modes include a Pacman clone, a memory game, swimming through rings, and protect barrels from Cogs. However, I did find them a bit tedious after a while.

The third type is golfing and racing, first one is just a regular mini-golf game where you can earn trophies (which gives a fancy outfit) and health meter boost, while racing is basically Mario Kart, and rewards tickets which unlocks new Karts or fashion accessories.

I also got to join a party at one point (and by "party" I mean the traditional version with balloons, and stuff) which is also another way to play minigames to earn beans, And players can create one themselves. There´s even a jukebox and other fun props to interact with.

Once I got enough beans, I headed into the Goofy Gag, the shop for all my gag needs which are necessary in order to fight the Cogs.

## Taking the Fight to The Streets

![A cartoon character fighting an Evil Robot](/images/2022/toonfight.jpg#center "Knock em Dead!")


Once I left the playground, I´ve found that the streets are filled with Gogs! But no worries, combat is easy to master, see one thing that makes it stand out it´s that combat is turn-based. With a couple of differences, for example instead of health, there´s a laff meter. The main objective here is to make the enemy laugh until it explodes.


![a cartoon character showing the laff meter](/images/2022/toontutorial.jpg#center)

![game screenshot showcasing options of combat abilities](/images/2022/toonbattlescreen.jpg#center)


But this requires some strategy, as certain attacks (called gags) are only efficient on certain enemy types. And instead of gaining experience points, you gain exp according to what gag you use. The more they get used the more upgrades they get.

Now I could just mindlessly keep battling to progress, but there are better ways to do it, that is when Cog invasions come in, it involves fighting wave after wave of enemies or by completing toontasks rewarding with even more laff points, and that should give enough experience, although can only one task can be done at a time, which can be a bit annoying. Also, I suggest having the [**wiki open**](https://toontown.wiki.gg/wiki/Cogs) to figure out where certain Cog types are located to complete it.


![a cartoon duck offering quests](/images/2022/toonquest.jpg#center)


Another neat feature is that other players can join the fight at any time, in fact, the game encourages casual teamups making progress really easy.


![evil looking grey buidling with eyes](/images/2022/tooncogtower.jpg#center "Even the Buildings are Evil")


And if I get other toons to my group I can then to join them at a Cog Building. These huge metal buildings function as the game's dungeon, where you battle wave after wave until reaching the boss. Once you´ve won, the building will be replaced with a regular Toontown building with photos of the players that liberated the building hanging on the walls for bragging rights.


![three cartoon character fighting three evil robots in a metal room](/images/2022/toondungeon.jpg#center)


There is also the Cog headquarters, these are permanently controlled Gog facilities inhabited by a boss Cog of a specific type. They´re a more elaborate and harder version of a Cog Building, and you will eventually be expected to perform tasks around the area.

## It´s Free Real Estate

How could I not mention the fact that you have player housing in this game? When you simply just wanna take a small break, or hang out quietly with your friends, there is a small neighborhood fit for that purpose.

Players can decorate their own house with furniture both from the Cattle-log (oh the puns) and save money in what is basically a candy machine.


![A purple cartoon deer adding candy to a candy machine](/images/2022/tooncandybank.jpg#center)


In the backyard, you can also do some fishing, as well as gardening, which requires the purchase of a kit. Besides just for decorative purposes, they can be used to increase the laff meter and improve the power of a gag. Planting flowers are done by combining certain jellybean colors.

This is also the place where I get to visit my very own pet called a doodle! This however is the only place players get to see them besides combat. They can be fed here, be played with and even teach them tricks. Doodles can also be called to aid in battle with their tricks so training is important.

They often come in different colors, body parts, and personality traits, and can be bought at the pet store. The options for available pets often change every day, and that´s depending on if a specific doodle was bought.

## Disney Copyright-Free


![A sign with the character goofy on it ](/images/2022/toongoofy.jpg#center)


Now, I know what all of you are thinking, how the heck did they maintained this game without being sued by the Big Mouse himself? Well, the creators of Rewritten pretty much removed all the Disney NPCs and replaced them with original characters. For example, Flippy the Dog is the mayor instead of Mickey. The only thing that reminds you that this is a Disney game are the shop names, statues, and street signs, and let´s hope it stays that way.

However, this means that players are not exactly playing the game in its original form, but it´s a much better compromise than having the project shut down.

But what they did manage to keep were the events, every year you have specific winter or Halloween events. (There´s also been a summer event this year) with the added bonus of community-led events. You can also earn exclusive outfits and participate in fun competitions.

## Game Rating

Now how does it hold out as a fan project? Pretty good actually, all the mechanics are here with a few minor tweaks to improve the game. The game is still getting updates, it has a vibrant and very friendly community. And it´s definitely what I would say a kid-friendly game.

There are barely any bugs and the game runs smoothly. So, if you´re in a nostalgic mood, or just like Disney games in general, this is a must-play.

But it can be boring for some players. I´m saying this as someone who missed out its original run, and only now got around to play it for the first time already as an adult and experienced online gamer. It´s best played with friends.
