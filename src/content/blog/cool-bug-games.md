As a kid, I was always fascinated by insects, and no doubt it was influenced by their presence in pop culture such as cartoons like (bugs life) or video games.

In fact, Pokemon itself was based on the insect collecting hobby that its creator enjoyed as a kid. Animal Crossing has a bug-catching mechanic, teaching me how to appreciate these creatures.

Due to this, I decided to take it upon myself and look into what kinds of other bug-based games are out there.

## 1.Hollow Knight

With a platform-style gameplay and challenging combat. There is a lot to see and explore.

You can battle over 30 bosses, explore an expansive and open world, gain and evolve new skills, equip items called charms that give you new abilities, and more.

Not to mention you get beautiful landscapes, and haunting music composed by Christopher Larkin.

One of my favorite aspects of the game is the character design, they really went all in giving them cool bug traits while mixing with a little bit of cuteness.

One word of warning, this is a really challenging game but the way this was created makes it worth it just to see all the secrets. The game also has several DLCs available, so I also recommend getting those.

## 2.Yoku´s Island Express

![yoku´s express poster](/images/2022/yokuislandexpress.jpg)

 This game is a Metroidvania but with a pinball twist. The main character Yoku is based on the dung beetle. Armed with only a ball, it´s your job as the island´s postmaster to deliver packages to its inhabitants and rebuild the post office. Meanwhile, there is also a sleeping God it´s up to you to wake him up and help the Island.

You get to explore the island through Pinball mechanics like bumpers and ramps, you can even get new powerups that make certain areas accessible.

For example, one such ability, the Sootling on a Leash allows you to attach a leash to certain objects to have more control over where you land and reach higher platforms.

Due to its open-linear gameplay, you are free to complete quests in any order, as well as pick different area routes. There´s also plenty of secrets to be found.

Not only is Yoku fun to play but probably the best way to introduce this genre to beginners, or maybe it´s because I´m a Pinball gaming veteran making this game a bit easy for my standards.

## 3.Bug Fables

![bug fables poster](/images/2022/bugfables.jpg#center)

In this RPG adventure, you follow three insect heroes, Vi, Kabbu, and Leif on their quest to find the everlasting sapling, a treasure that grants immortality.

You get to explore Bulgaria a continent full of other treasures, different environments, and puzzles that you must solve to progress and help the locals.

The fun part of the gameplay is your typical turn-based gameplay but with action moves. Other game elements include a crafting system, where you can create your own items to help you in battle as well as platform jumping.

Also, its mechanics and cute 2D paper cutout style actually reminded me of Paper Mario, it really hits hard on that nostalgia factor.

## 4.Empires of the Undergrowth

![empires of the undergrowth poster](/images/2022/empireundergrotwh.jpg)

I always wanted to have an ant farm and loved Ant Sim, so I was delighted to hear about this game. This is an ant colony management game with real-time strategy gameplay.

You start the game with a Queen and command the new colony workers to quickly dig a nest, carve tunnels, and raise the next generation.

Throughout the game, you will have to confront a variety of enemies, from fierce predators to rival colonies. Gathering food and conquering new territories is also a must if you want your colony to succeed.

You can even say this is an educational game based on its realistic ant behavior, it gives a new perspective on the life of an ant.

## 5.Metamorphosis

![metamorphosis poster](/images/2022/metamorphis.png)

If you´re a literature fanatic, you´ve probably heard of this story before: A man wakes up and finds himself turned into a bug.

Yes, I just described Franz Kafka´s famous Metamorphosis novel, now available in video game form!

You are put into the shoes of Gregor, the protagonist from the novel, while his friend gets into trouble with the law and ends up arrested.

Gregor now a bug receives a mysterious message about reaching some kind of tower in order to find the answers to his new situation and perhaps save his friend?

In the game you get an insect´s point of view, with Gregor´s house turned into an expansive world filled with obstacles and getting contact with a hidden bug society.

The gameplay consists of puzzle platforming, you can use your new body like a bug to climb vertically to most surfaces.

There are a lot of interesting and surreal elements that make you want to play it to the end just to find an answer to all the mysteries in this game.

## 6.Bugsnax

![Bugsnax GameCover](/images/2022/Bugsnax.jpg)

This last entry is a little different. Rather than being based on any real insects the focus on these fantastical creatures Bugsnax, part Bug, part food.

As a nameless journalist, you are invited to Snaktooth Island to document and possibly capture these guys. There are about 100 species to discover, a variety of methods to catch them.

You can also feed them to Grumpuses, who are the dominant intelligent life on their Island, You know when I look at them, they kinda remind me of the Muppets. Their appearance can change according to the Bugsnax they eat.

As for the Bugsnax themselves, I kind of admit the idea of picking a real species and insects and making it look like a snack is very creative. Also, I dig the google eyes, that´s adorable.

A lot of this game takes inspiration from games like Pokemon Snap and Viva La Pinãta, it´s definitely a kid-friendly game. So, bonus points for the nostalgia factor.
