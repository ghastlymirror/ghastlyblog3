So with 1st August marks the beginning of Blaugust and this blog´s second year of participation.

If you haven´t heard it before, what´s Blaugust you ask? It´s a once a year event focused on blogging, where bloggers are encouraged to write more frequently. It also helps foster a sense of community among your fellow writers and perhaps discover new people to check out.

The event was created by [Tales of The Aggronaut](https://aggronaut.com/2023/07/12/blaugust-2023-is-coming/) and writers are given a series of prompts to help get around writers block, plus a couple of achievements and even a small badge you can put on your blog to showcase your participation.

Which brings me to my next point, as you all know this year has been really weird and terrible year for those who use social media.

Ever since Elon Musk brought twitter (and killed the bird, [look how well its doing](https://www.raconteur.net/design-innovation/twitter-rebrand-x-disaster)), Reddit making its site unsuable thanks to [its new Api policies](https://www.techradar.com/news/the-end-of-reddit-heres-why-most-of-the-site-is-down-and-what-happens-next), and whatever the [fuck is going on Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/staff/722502027705565184/hi-folks-there-seems-to-be-a-lot-of?source=share) , online users have been scrambling to find new alternatives.

As matter of fact i myself joined said alternatives, I´ve posting updates on my mastodon account, and sometimes I will post on cohost.

While that is all well and good I would like to present a third probably a much longer term option for a online home, having a blog.

Whether you you use a blog hosting service (such as wordpress or blogger, or heck even dreamwidth) or host it yourself, there are many advantages. From having more control over your stuff, to not deal with a ton of online discourse, and just focus on what actually matters to you.

While traditional blogging isn´t as popular as it once was, I wouldn´t discount it completely, it´s still for example a useful way for people to find information on certain topics.

And even if you still use socmed anyway, its nice to take a break on a more slowpaced medium, plus can even use socmed to get more eyes on your blog, and there´s also the rss blog feeds.

So it was in this spirit of preserving traditional blogging somewhat that this event was made, a way to help new bloggers take their steps, for old veterans to keep that creative spark going.

And I hope yall join me as I´ll be writing here during the entire month.
