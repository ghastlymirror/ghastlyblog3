During one October I decided to try my hand at drawing skulls for a Halloween challenge.

Now I´ve always struggled with anatomy, specially if I´m trying to draw a realisitc body part, so I decided to turn to the internet for my self education. This is the result.

First I got my hand on this cool tutorial:

<br>

Following the steps, I drew the lines that would serve me as a guide to constructing a skull.

Then I started to fill in

I didn´t stop there. I watch more tutorials and started to fill a page with my own designs. Some are great while others not so much. But it was a fun exercise.

But I wasn´t done, I found another tutorial but these ones were stylized, still cool though.

So, yeah this was a fun little project that I wanted to share here, Ever since I picked up drawing, and I have been interested in documenting my learning progress and sharing it with other people online. And maybe these video tutorials can be use to some beginners as well.
