  A continuation of my previous posts, mostly to avoid it being oo long of an article.
  Here we got more cool bugs, like bumblebees, flies, and even moths.

This is a continuation [of my previous post](/blog/bug-safari-spiders-and-dragonflies), because if I did put this there, it would be way too long and who has that kind of time?

So I´ve got some more cool bugs, bees, flies and even moths.

## 1.Bumblebee

Living in the coastal area one very common plant I see is the Hottentot-fig plant (*Carpobrotus edulis*)  A species of succulent with these colorful flowers. The irony is that this a non-native species, going so far as to be invasive in some regions.

But on the other hand, it is an attractive plant for some pollinators such as the cute Bumblebee (*Bombus terrestris*).[^1]

While often mistaken for honey bees, these fluffy bugs have a similar social structure, with a queen, female workers, and of course, drones and forage for pollen and nectar. However, unlike honey bees, they do no make honey.

Another difference is their bigger furry bodies. Their name itself comes from their bumbling flight.

Best season to see them? The best time season to see them is during summer and spring.

## 2.Diptera

Diptera is known to be the order to which insects like flies and mosquitos belong too. While these two are the first thing that comes to mind when talking about this order, in reality, they occupy other niches besides just beings a pest, such as this hoverfly of the **Syrphidae family**.[^2]


![A small fly with black and yellow lines like a small bee or wasp on a human hand](/images/2022/hoverflyonhand.jpg)

Funny enough I did not what it was when it first landed on my hand at a beach it had the color of a wasp but the shape is different.

They're named after their habit of being seen hovering mid-air or over flowers. While the adults feed on nectar, their larvae are carnivorous, preying on plant-sucking insects like aphids, making them a great tool for pest control.

While harmless it is believed their yellow and black color serves as a deterrent for predators.

And to think I didn´t know they existed before one landed on me.

Next up is a photo of a Robberfly.[^3] These guys are full-on predators, they´re really good when it comes to hunting flying bugs, while they prefer to capture smaller prey, they can sometimes be found going after bigger ones. They're the falcons of the fly world.

You can easily recognize them by their long abdomens, a mystax composed of stiff hair that looks like a mustache (protecting them from struggling prey), elevated eyes, and a proboscis which they use to inject a concoction of neurotoxins and enzymes, which kills their food.

Don´t worry, despite their intimidating appearance, they´re harmless to humans.

This just your typical house fly.[^4] They can sometimes act as pollinators too, who knew. Mind you this was an early attempt of using a macro lens.

And I managed to find these in the same place I found the bumblebees, it was a warm summer-like day, and since the plants were in bloom they attracted a lot of insects.

## 3.Lepidoptera

Ah, yes the order of butterflies and moths one of the most charismatic groups of insects.

Despite being similar they are only a couple of differences,[^5] for example, moths, unlike butterflies, rest with their wings open, they have furry bodies, mostly nocturnal (though there are exceptions), and have a leaf-like shape for their antenna. day and all the plants seem to attract a large variety of insects.


![A large orange Moth resting on a wood post](/images/2022/orangemoth.jpg#original)

Some can even be colorful and even cute looking such as this orange moth which is called a Oak Eggar (*Lasiocampa quercus*) I saw again at the beach.


![A black catterpillar with white dots and a red head](/images/2022/catterpillarlily.jpg)




In the same area, I also found this cool-looking caterpillar, a Lily Borer (*Brithys crini*) chewing its way out of a plant on the dunes. I think it might belong to the same species as this moth. But hey it looks cool.


![A brown butterfly with brown and white stripes on a white flower](/images/2022/bluebutterflyflower.jpg)



In this next photo is a Lang's short-tailed blue (*Leptotes pirithous*) that is I identified it correctly.

Males of this species are known for being more colorful than the female males, with a gorgeous bluish color on the upperside.

I suspect this one might be a female.


![A small Moth on a Window](/images/2022/windowmoth.jpg)

And last but not least this small common moth resting on my window enjoying the sun´s rays. Forgive me since I don´t know the identification of this one, but I thought it looked neat and wanted to see I could get a decent picture of it against the glass. I think I did okay despite using a smartphone.

## Final Thoughts

I hope you all enjoyed this post and learning a bit more about the bug world. If you happen to have any questions, noticed I made a mistake or wanna help me identify some of the unknown species, feel free to comment below. Feedback is always welcome.
