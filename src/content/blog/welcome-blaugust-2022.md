Hello, Ghastly here.

I´m proud to announce that this blog has joined this years Blaugust event! An event dedicated to promote and even inspire the traditional blogging sphere, you can read more about this **[event here](https://aggronaut.com/2022/07/15/introducing-blaugust-2022/).**

Essentially I plan to blog as much as I can this month, though not necessarily all the 31 days.

I figured I only post sparingly and I was having a sort of writer´s block at the moment so this might be just the thing to help. And I wish to get to know the blogosphere community a bit better.

So far I´ve had this blog for a couple of months now, and it has been an interesting experience, an experiment if you will. Don´t get me wrong I´m not that new I´ve had a tumblr blog for a decade, but it was more of a place to randomly show memes and discuss things with people than a blog in the traditional sense.

But I liked the feeling of planning out and slowly meticulously post updates like once a week.

If any of you are just reading my blog for the first time, hi there, a couple things to expect from me is that I enjoy writing about videogames I´ve played, share cool animal photos I´ve taken, and sometimes even a little about the state of the internet today.

Outside Wordpress you find me on more traditional social media linked in my sidebar (may or maybe not always be active)

I´ve also recently joined the fediverse through [**Mastodon**](https://blorbo.social/@creaturefeature)

Lastly, I have a personal static website called [**Creature Feature!**](https://creaturefeature.neocities.org/) Yes one of those old-school HTML coded sites hosted by Neocities, and it serves as just a repository of all my basic interests with a Halloween theme if you´re into that.

If you´re also participating feel free to comment, and even send me a link to your blog, I´m looking to read new stuff.
