![Animal Crossing](/images/blog/animal-crossing-startscreen.jpg)

I´ve been playing Animal crossing for a couple of days. So here´s what I´ve been up too now in Batvale.

First things, first. Two new Villagers moved in, a cute goat named Chevre, and a Kangaroo named Mathilda.

Now Chevre is a complete sweetheart, one of the first things she asked me to do was plant some flowers near her house, she wants a garden you see.

Took me two days, but she gave me a huge teddy bear out of it.

![Chevre saying: You went to all that trouble plating the flowers, so don´t worry about watering them. I´ll do it, la baa!](/images/2023/chevregoatanimalcrosisng.jpeg#center)


Mathilda... not so much. Things went off to a wrong start. I was trying to talk to her, but the I was carrying the new bug net I just bought (yes I can catch bugs now). And since I was at the wrong angle pressing the A button in resulted in well her getting mad at me and with this response:

![Angry Mathilda saying: You filthy ogre! I hope you get stung by a thousand bees!](/images/2023/animalcorssingkanga.jpeg#center)

Did I forget to mention how meaner the Villagers are compared to the newer version. Althought face its funnier that way.

I felt bad but then I found she was a very snooty Villager, she gave some backhanded compliment at Poncho´s house decor, plus I´m pretty sure she is running an Underground Casino at this point.

She did give me a gift though, after feeling insulted that I told her outfit was just okay instead of amazing.

![Mathilda saying: you know what? I´ll give you this outfit. Yes. It´s one of my absolute favorites, wee baby.](/images/2023/animalcrossingcasino.png#medium)

I´ve been bonding a little bit with other Villagers, Cashmere played a trading game with me, but the fun starts late at night.

![cashmere the sheep asking: Would you like to play a game? I´ll name some items and if you hear one you want, just say "stop!"](/images/2023/cashmereanimalcrossing.png#medium)


The hilarious thing is finding a bunch of villagers just asleep in front of their houses and it´s up to me to wake them up so they can go to be properly.

But there was one villager that it was still awake this time of night. Its none other than the local celeb Tom!

![Tom the blue cat saying: What´s with you, freakshow?
Don´t tell me you´re out sleepwalking the night away...
Are you, me- YOWZA?](/images/2023/tomcatanimalcrossing.png#medium "Just a couple of freaks chilling at night.")

Him, Cashmere and yes even Mathilda are pretty much Nightowls.

I also found something interesting. One of the main features in the game is if you have a Gameboy Advance you could connect it directly to the Gamecube and acess a special island.

Even thought the emulator also has a Gameboy emulation feature, I haven´t figured out how it works yet, so instead I used a cheatcode.

After that Kapp´n shows up, I get to hear his little song was I ride the boat, and in I discover the Island of Kokomo, and I meet another new face, a Pirate.

![Kapp´n saying: Shove off! We´re bound fer Kokomo Island! To the briny sea!](/images/2023/animalcrossingkappaboat.png#medium)

The are is small, but it does provide me with coconuts which I can then plant on my own Town as long as its on the F row. I also get a cabana with some free shirts. I can decorate it.

By the way if you´re curious about the cheat code here it is. On the Dolphin emulator you go to tools > cheat manager >AR code > Add new code and type this:

04414cd4 38600001

045756a8 38600001

And you should be good to go.

And good news I caught my very first bug:

![player catching a mosquite under neat it says: I caught a mosquito! I´ve been itching to catch me one of these!](/images/2023/mosquitocatchanimalcrossing.png#medium "About damn time, these things keep biting me.")
