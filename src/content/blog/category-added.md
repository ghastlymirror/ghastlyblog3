This blog has been around for week, and I´ve already made progress so far.

I added a Photography Category on the navigation menu. While I started initially thinking about making this solely a gaming-focused blog (and it still is) I´d rather have all my interests in a single place instead of managing two sites at the same time.

So, maybe this might become more of a hobby blog? I don´t know.

While the category is still mostly empty, I plan on showcasing my nature photography photos there, maybe even say something about the species I´ve caught on camera, making it a little bit educational.

Mind you, I´m still new to this, I never actually created and ran my own blog like this, most of my blogging experience is limited to tumblr, I´m trying to make an experiment out of it.

If someone reads this and has any suggestions how to improve this site please feel free to comment below.
