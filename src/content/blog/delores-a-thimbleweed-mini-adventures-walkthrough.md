## Video Summary
This title is a spinoff of the Thimbleweed Park Game, set supposedly after the events of the main story. But instead the two detectives, the plot focuses aroun Delores the budding game developer who has return to her hometown for a long deserved vacation.

She also has offered to help the local newspaper to find some stories, armed with a camera the players or able to revisit some key locations and characters from the last game.

A key difference though, is that there a lack of voiceovers, but other than that the game is just as solid as the first one.

The is available for free, althought I would advise people to play Thimbleweed Park first.
