In my [last post](/blog/welcome-to-blaugust-2023) I mentioned how having a blog might be a decent option to have an online space of your own besides regular social media.

So I decided to make some recomendations of my own, I have divided these types on blogging services into two categories, social blogging and more traditional blog hosting.

## Social Blogging

While the focus here is still mostly on long form posts, this services also have more social elements that are more familiar to users of social media. One of the advantages of this type is that it makes it easier to interact with a bigger community.

### Dreamwidth

The [structure of this site](https://www.dreamwidth.org/) is probably more familiar to those who used Livejournal. It provides users with a personal Journal, and you get to create or join communites around a specific subject and post solely in there instead of your blog.

The thing I enjoy the most is its privacy setting, it´s much easy to control who gets acess to your posts, you can close or limit who comments, decided if you want your blog to be searchable and even private your entries.

In fact you can even use it as a private online diary just for you, you can subscribe to other people's blogs and decide if you wanna give them acess to your private entries and make part of your inner circle.

This is the most important aspect for me, since in our current environment that allows for online harrassment, its good to have some protections.

Not to mention you can customize the look of your journal, either by using a pre-made layout provided for the site/other users or make one yourself.

You´re also allowed to post NSFW content provided your label your post as such, you also have the option to put on an age restriction.

This site is sorta popular with Fandom Communities so, don´t be suprised if you see a lot of communites based around fanfiction, or tv shows in there.

One tip is you if have a personal site you can also display your blog there throught this [helpful tutorial](https://sadgrl.online/learn/articles/blog-dreamwidth).

### CoHost

:::note
At the time of this post Cohost is no longer available. I´m only keeping this entry for archival purposes
:::

I [find this one](https://cohost.org/) to be very similar to Tumblr, mostly for its ability to create sideblogs on a single acount. However it does something better than its predecessos, is that you can follow people from your sideblogs.

Yeah, one of the things I often complain about Tumblr is that I can only follow people from my main blog but not my sideblog, leading to a lot of confusion for people trying to figure why a random blog is suddenly interacting with all their posts, and I had to point out to several of my mutuals to follow me from my sideblogs.

Which does lead you to have different feeds, but at the same time its makes it easier for organization purposes, you can have art blog, or an adult blog completely separated from each other.

You can reblog other posts, makes use of the tag system even pin them on your blog or add them to your feed.

Light html and css can be used to format posts, but best of all it privacy friendly. It has no ads, no algorithm, your following lists are private.

In terms of adult content yes it is allowed, provided you label your posts as such, also putting other content warnings is encouraged, this is so that people can decided wether or not to see your post.

It also has acessibility options.

Keep in mind the site is till new, so you might not have a lot of engangement compared to other places, but I´ve tested it and it seems like my photography posts have more engagement than say instagram or tumblr.

### Pillowfort


![Pillowfort site](/images/2023/pillowfort.jpg#original)

To describe it, its [Tumblr and Livejournal combined](https://www.pillowfort.social/), for the Tumblr aspect you get to reblog from other people, and the blog layout is very similar.

For livejournal similarites its has communities, you can choose to only post to a speficic community or your blog.

It also does something a little bit better than Tumblr is that your posts are organized by original posts and reblogs, so you dont have to worry much about your own original content be buried under a sea of shared posts.

Like my previous two entries, yes NSFW stuff is allowed specially since you have the option to label them as such (you can even add a small 18+ badge on your profile to give a heads up) and the filter options seems decent, you can actually avoid sexual content altogehter is that is what you want.

Another feature is that you´re able to hide your blog from searches and only allow acess to people you follow. It does not hide your community posts, but it´s great if you simply wanna focus on the community aspect and only interact with people you trust.

That being said, the site is not very active and its very slowpaced. On one hand is great if you want something a bit quieter and niche, but not so great if you´re using it to promote your work. There is also no algorithm so you got have to go out of your way to find content yourself.

Mind you there is a waiting list when you make and account although I heard is much faster these days, but the best way is still to get an invite.

I´m able to provide people with one, so if anyone interested you can request one, either my comments or simply contact me.

## Traditional Blogging

This section showcase more traditional blogging services, the social aspect in here is much more limited (unless you count comments and blog rolls) and has a bit of learning curve for those trying this style of blogging for the first time.

### Blogger


![Blogger site](/images/2023/blogger.png#medium)

One of the oldest and still running blogging sites out there, previously known as blogspot.

You can chose a layout, associated with your own domain, and even easily monetize it through ad sense. And if you have a google account you can make up to 100 blogs if you want.

However It can be more limiting in some areas, it still does its job if you´re looking for a hobby blog.

You can also use google photos to host images on your blog, which is up to 15gb for free, which is actually a large number actually compared to other hosts.

### Wordpress.com

![wordpress.com site](/images/2023/wordpresssites.jpg#medium)

:::note
This entry is here for archival purposes. Due to some issues with Automatic´s Ceo I can no longer reccomend this site in good Faith. However, if you like some of its features you can install wordpress and use your hosting service of choice, go to [wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/download/) for more information
:::

Not to be mistaken by wordpress.org, while they both use the same wordpress software one is available as a free service. While the second might require to pay for hosting in order to start using it. 

Fun fact, This blog was actually created through a wordpress.com account.

It does provide you with an account in which you can make several blogs, and you can pick a theme an easily customize your blog at your leisure, and posting is easy to do.

However, there are limits, for one free account has to deal with banner and ads, which can only be removed through a subscription.

Free accounts have up to 3gb for media storage, which should suffice but you will need to pay to expand or you can just use a third part image host.

But if you wanna pay to have more features my advice its not worth it, it´s too expensive for what they are offering and at this point you´re better off paying for hosting and simply install wordpress on it, since you would have the same experience for a cheaper price.


### Host your Blog


![Neocities Hosting](/images/2023/neocitiesbanner.png#original)

This one personally is the best option, as in you have complete and total freedom over your content or features.

This one however takes a much bigger learning curve since you don´t have a blog available from scratch. That being said is not impossible to learn.

Like I previously mentioned, the most popular option is to use a host service plus wordpress.

Or you can learn [basic html on this site](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_blog_layout.asp), althought one kind person has created a blog template [called zonelets](https://zonelets.net/) ready to use and you can even modify it somewhat.

Which ones to pick? Well, the good news is that there is a variety of price options from free to paid, just pick one you think [suits you best](https://kalechips.net/stuff/hosting). Also this site has some decent [guides for self-hosting](https://theselfhostingblog.com/tag/guides/).



## Conclusion

As you can see there is no end to the variety of options you have for blogging, wether you are starting out, just want a place to put down your thoughts or becoming a professional blogger.

I do recomend trying it if nothing as alternative to fast pace online spaces.
