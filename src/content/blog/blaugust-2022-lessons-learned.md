Wow, time flies by. Participating in this challenge has certainly been an experience.

Also, I got to meet a ton of new to meet new bloggers that are now gonna be part of my daily feed and also a couple of new followers as well, I guess everyone wins.

So, how did I go? Well, so far I got (if you count this one) 18 posts, not bad compared to a slow month last July.

I also used this as an opportunity to speed the process of finishing older drafts that were just sitting there for months, this gave me the motivation to get off my ass and post them.

As for the lessons learned?

It was figuring out how to run a blog. To be fair I might have mentioned before, most of my blogging experiences were mostly around Tumblr. I didn´t exactly put a lot of thought into what I posted, so having to go through more traditional forms of blogging it forced me to be a little more creative and even got to the process of picking a theme.

I think I´m starting to get the hang of it, I still make a few mistakes here and here, but that is part of the learning process.

I also used this as an opportunity to be more active online instead of simply just being passive and scrolling through social media. I really needed a different hobby, something to make the web fun again for me.

After this, I might take a small break, and then this blog will return to it´s more weekly posting schedule or depending when I´m available.

As for those of you who followed, gave feedback and even commented, I would like to say a huge thank you, and I hope you will stick around.
