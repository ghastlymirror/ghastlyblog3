And now a break from my gaming posts.

On a sunny day in June I decided to take a hike on this nature reserve situated in the Portuguese town of Vila do Conde, under the name the NaturConde Armed with my trusty Canon camera, I saw an opportunity to capture some interesting photos.


## Black Bird

The first animal I managed to encounter was this [**Common Blackbird** (*Turdus merula*)](https://www.biodiversity4all.org/taxa/12716-Turdus-merula) it´s a very common around here. It was so dark I almost didn´t see. I don´t know if it can be not noticed but it had a small branch on it´s beak.

But wish I could´ve caught more birds, but due to the presence of trees, it´s easier hearing than seeing them. There were also a couple of birdhouses hanging out.

## Bocage´s Wall Lizard

As I payed attention to the ground the second animal I manage to find was [**Bocage´s Wall Lizard** (*Podarcis bocagei*)](https://www.biodiversity4all.org/taxa/35706-Podarcis-bocagei). This one was tricking to identify as it is very similar to some of the other species in Portugal in Spain like the [**Carbonelli Lizard**(*Podarcis carbonelli*)](https://www.biodiversity4all.org/taxa/35707-Podarcis-carbonelli) or [**The Green Lizard**(*Podarcis virescens*)](https://www.biodiversity4all.org/taxa/424860-Podarcis-virescens)

Again, a very common species, I often see them around urban areas or sand dunes, but this is the first time I actually managed to take a close-up photo of one! Usually, they are just too quick, often running away before I get my camera out.



## Robber Fly

The vegetation also seems to attract a couple of bugs as well. Here, what it looks like a giant mosquito, is actually a Robber Fly. These guys are active predators, often catching other insects mid-flight, making them the Hawks among the Insect Kingdom.

This was actually my first time seeing one, and I never knew such an animal existed, and they are part of the order of Diptera, related to houseflies and mosquitos.



## Speckled Wood Butterfly

Last but not least, I found several of these [**Speckled Wood Butterflies** (*Pararge aegeria*)](https://www.biodiversity4all.org/taxa/52592-Pararge-aegeria) I caught so many good shots it was hard to decide which one to pick.

So yes, it was a very productive hike and I got to see so many interesting things. I plan on talking more about this place in the future.
