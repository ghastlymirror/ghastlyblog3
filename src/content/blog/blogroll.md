In a stroke of inspiration, I decided to add a couple of interesting sites on my navigation.

A lot of blogs I´ve been following seem to have one of those in some form, whether they are part of mutual network of bloggers or just sites that have caught their interest.

For the curious my recommended site list is as it follows:

- [**Old-Games.com**](https://www.old-games.com/games/simulation/27)  A site archive with a ton of old pc games to discover! Do not be intimidated by it´s old 90´s/early 2000s apearance as it has a variety of games to discover including more obscures ones that you won´t be able to find anywhere. They´ve even been modified to funtion on more mordern PCs. It has a download limit, though.

- [**The Collection Chamber**](https://collectionchamber.blogspot.com/): Set up on blogger. This 90´s gaming site is great for newcomers specially those who trouble in setting up the DOSBox emulator. Just download and install. They even come with game manuals.

- [**Vimm´s Lair**](https://vimm.net/?p=vault): Another retro game archive but for console gaming. You can find games there that date from 1985 to 2008 in a variety of platforms. Not only that, you can find recommended emulators and even download the original game manuals. A great find for your typical gaming archeologist

- [**Old Games Download**](https://oldgamesdownload.com/): An abandownware and retrogaming site. Although all of the games there are linked to the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) it has an organized database according to year, genre and plataform. Has it´s fair share of jewels

- [**Aywren´s Gaming Blog**](https://aywren.com/): Another fellow blogger with a site dedicated to games and other geeky stuff. I actually got the idea of starting this worpress blog from her.

- [**The Yesterweb**](https://yesterweb.org/): A blast from the past! A site dedicated to the oldweb (remember those old 90´s websites?) with a small but active community. With articles exploring how the internet has changed and focusing on finding alternatives from the social medial, corporitized web to a much smaller and private personal web. You might even be inspired to make a personal webpage of your own, go nuts.

- [**Elephant´s Eye on False Bay**](https://eefalsebay.blogspot.com/): A small photography and nature blog that I just found randomly on the internet. It is dedicated to documenting biodiveristy in False Bay, South Africa.

- [**Biodiversity4all**](https://www.biodiversity4all.org/home): A citizen science website. I use this is to document all my findings on nature hikes or identify some unknown species. Basically you create and account there, upload a photo as proof of the organism you found and voilá. Your observations then become part of a database that can even be used by researchers. It is associated with the mobile app [iNaturalist](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.inaturalist.android&gl=US)
