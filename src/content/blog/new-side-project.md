description: I´ve been focusing mostly in crafting and old-school website on neocities. Here´s what motivated me to take the leap to coding a personal homepage of my own.

If you´re one of the few people who has been following this blog for some time, you might have noticed I haven´t posted for a while...

That is mostly because I´ve lately been focusing most of my energy crafting an old-school website hosted in Neocities. Handcrafted even, no using website builders, just using a text editor for HTML coding.

It has been.... quite an experience. I had to learn an entire new skill set.

The hardest part was figuring out what theme I was going for. i didn´t just want it to be another throwback to the late 90s/2000s web with nothing but flashing gif and garish graphics, I wanted something that had a bit more substance.

See back in the day, personal websites were more of a norm, with just about any subject, from tv shows to their pet dog, in fact my main hangout back in the day were fansites, I want to experience some of it again.

So, I figure why not make a site about one my favorite subject matters (monsters and biology) with some personal stuff like art or journal entries in the middle.

Of course, nowadays that has fallen in favour of social media like twitter or Instagram, with even the act of traditional blogging no longer being popular like it was in the past.

Which brings me to the second reason I decided to make this. I´m getting tired of how toxic social media is becoming. Yeah, know, it sounds cliche at this point to say social media is bad.

But in these past few months I´ve seen things even fandom spaces going off their rocker, with people harassing online friends of mine, heck even I was harrassed for speaking out on this behavior, all because ships or fanart offended their um "puritan sensibilities". There is something about it that makes people forget to respect boundaries, that there is a person behind the screen.

That is because social media is designed to profit from conflict. You wanna know why they haven´t yet implemented proper structures in place that protect their users from hate speech? Because if they did that, then engagement would slow down a little bit. they need haters to run the engine or else there go their profits.

and the lack of privacy, or misinformation etc...

So, I figure that I might as well make my refuge on the web. Where I have a bit more control over my own content. No ads, no dumbass prompts asking permission for cookies, no worry about some algorithm that is impossible to master, and best of all not dealing with a barrage of hatred.

I´m happy to report, that i´ve sorta started to not use social media so much as I did in the past, and the internet has returned to be a fun place again sorta. Mostly due to me finding a new creative outlet.

Okay, well this turned into an unplanned rant, but I just wanted to mention how important it was for people to have their own personal online space, outside just the few four websites everyone flocks to.

Anyway, if anyone is curious about my website project you can see it at: https://creaturefeature.neocities.org/

I´m constantly adding new stuff there, and who knows it might inspire someone.
