As of today I finished transferring all my old 2022 posts to this site´s archive and I can now start working on uploading the ones for 2023 and 2024.

Those are proably gonna take less work, I´ve been looking at them and looks like 2022 was the year where I wrote the most. I think its because I was trying to estabilish some sort of readerbase by trying to update more frequently since its a new blog, and also I guess I was sorta stuck at home during the whole pandemic thing but it was starting to die out, but I was still taking a lot of percautions and avoiding going out as much as possible (in some ways i´m still am).

So I guess I got my writting on as much as possible. I´m thinking of maybe taking a small break and maybe write a new game review. I´ve just finished playing Witches & Vampires: The Secrets of Ashbury and I´m in the process of sharing my own thoughts of it.

Anyway for those olds readers and new, who stuck with this blog so far, thanks for you patronage. I also make sure to read your comments on social media and feedback is always welcome.
