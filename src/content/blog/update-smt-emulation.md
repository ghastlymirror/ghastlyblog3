No posts this week. But since [my last post on the subject](/blog/game-graveyard-atlus-shutdown) I came across even more details about this case as well some good news for once:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LuwQKDRK2h4?si=ukxMfIe7iP2fLPyh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

To summarize, we´re given an actual reason to why the Re:Imagine site was taken down, also it turns out there is still at least one public fan server standing.

This is great because I had initial plans of replaying it months ago but I would often end up procrastinating, only to receive the bad news.

Keep in mind though, in these kinds of servers there is an added risk in having all your progress just go poof at any moment should atlus or even other companies decided to go out and sue.

But if you´re a gaming history nerd like me, they might at least let you experience a bit of the past.
