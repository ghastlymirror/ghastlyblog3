![Top Five Adventure Games](/images/blog/top-5-adventure-games.jpg)

Lucas Arts was a gaming staple in the 80s and 90s. Mostly known for its adventure games, such as Manic Mansion, Day of the Tentacle, Sam & Max, etc. It left a mark on many people´s childhood, being known for its challenging puzzles and its humor.

It has since inspired a generation of gamers and developers, many of which went on to put their own twist.

So without further ado, here are my favorite games that I think Lucas Arts fans should check out:

## 1.Dropsy

In Dropsy you play a lovable and friendly clown, whose circus suffered from a terrible fire. Despite having an offputting appearance, all the main character wants to do is help people and give them hugs. Interestingly enough, the game has no dialogue. Instead, you have to interpret the symbols that shows up in dialog bubbles to deduce what each character wants.

In typical Lucas Arts fashion, you have a bunch of quirky characters to interact with, a open world to explore and many fun puzzles Also you get a pet dog, who doesn´t like having cute puppies around.

## 2.Timbleweed Park

What happens if you were to mix Twin Peaks with your typical Lucasarts formula? The result is Timbleweed Park, which just so happens to be created by Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick, the creators of Monkey Island.

In this detective mystery, you explore the town of Thimbleweed Park, a place full of weirdos and a dead corpse that no one seems to care about. In this adventure, you get to control up to 5 characters and use to solve various puzzles, which was inspired by the game mechanic in [**Maniac Mansion.**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniac_Mansion) Each character has it´s own character art and different dialogue. It is recommended you go back and interact with objects and people just to see the different reactions.

It has a fun 1980s noir setting, jokes, and different difficulty settings. This a must play for your adventure game collection. Also they just recently launched a spinoff called Delores: A Thimbleweed Park Mini-Adventure for [**free**](http://gog.com/game/delores_a_thimbleweed_park_miniadventure) on GOG, but if you can also find it on Steam and Epic Games, as well.

While you can check it out, I do recommend playing the main game first, since it revisits several characters and locations there.

## 3.A Vampyre Story

This game was also made by the same folks responsible for Monkey Island under the game studio Autumn Moon.

In this darkly comic gothic tale you play as Mona the Vampyre, a young opera singer turned damsel in distress. Locked up in a castle and turned into a creature of the night by the evil Baron Von Shrowdy, Mona has to find a way out and return to Paris so she can continue her singing career.

With the help of her companion Froderik, a snarky bat, they face various perils and meet all sorts of quirky characters.

Besides your typical Mokey Island-like gameplay, the game has beautiful hand-painted backgrounds, and a lot of character designs look like something out of a Tim Burton Movie. The vampire and spooky theme made this game a personal favorite of mine, and a joy to replay again and again.

## 5.Unavowed

Created by Wadjet Eye Games, in this urban fantasy game, you play as an Agent of the Unavowed, a group that fights supernatural threats. Recruited after dealing with a terrible case of demonic possession, it´s up to your character to find out what the demon had done while in possession of their body.

Like Manic Mansion and Timbleweed park, you get to control different characters, and the puzzles you´ll have to solve will change depending on who you choose to bring in each mission, making this game replayable.

It also has a new twist on the genre, character creation, and dialogue choices which impact the ending of the game. I like that this game strays a little from linear gameplay.

## 5.Blackwell Legacy

Aside from also being made by Wadjet Eye Games, this also is set in the same universe as the previous entry and is kind of a prequel, at least from the perspective of one of the ghost characters from Unavowed.

You follow Rosa Blackwell an introverted woman who after her aunt´s death, finds out she comes from a long line of female mediums. She also meets her aunt´s previous ghost companion, Malone a ghost who died in the 20s with a sarcastic personality.

Her new purpose in life is to help ghosts pass on by figuring out how they died, giving an element of a murder mystery,

Now unlike most point-and-click games, it relies less on inventory puzzles and more on making deductions with information you acquire by interviewing people.

With a jazzy soundtrack, the story takes players on a journey to real New York locations and more obscure bits of its history. The game is mostly episodic, but as you play you´ll find more about the Blackwell family history, Mallone´s past, and even deal with a world-shattering event.
