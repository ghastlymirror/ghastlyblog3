Well I kinda screwed up really screwed up, or probably the emulator I was using screwed up on me.

So, this was my second day in the Town of Batvale, so I managed to gather some bells by selling fruit and some shells, and got me my very first tool a shovel!

I went back to work digging, most of the thing buried were gyroids, but then I got my first ever fossil.

![player finding a fossil saying: Check it out!I dug up a fossil!](/images/2023/Screenshot_2023-08-07-17-41-34-463_org.dolphinemu.dolphinemu.md.jpeg#center)

Went straight to Blathers. But turns out fossil donation works a bit different here from other games. Blather´s doens´t have the proper permits to evaluate fossils, so he says I will be expecting a letter from the Farway museum soon, and then. I´ll be able to mail them my specimens.


![a letter its says
Welcome, ghastly.
The Farway Museum cordially invites you to take part in its free fossil identification program. Send us any fossil you find, and we´ll identify it and return it promptly.
Thanks for your support!](/images/2023/Screenshot_2023-08-07-17-28-51-536_org.dolphinemu.dolphinemu.md.jpeg#center)

Another interesting thing, is that sometimes the ground is glowing and if you dig that area you will find a bag of bells. And good to see that the magic bell rock is also a thing and not just in the sequels.

If you haven´t heard about this trick, is that every day a different rock will give out bell if you hit it with a shovel. Of course the best way to do it is to dig a hole behind you and on your side in order to maximise the number of bells.

Afterwards I went to do some chores for villagers. It´s official my current Job is now Delivery boy.

This time around, most of my errands involve Jambette who for keeps borrowing stuff from people. I even bondend with Tom the cat a bit and told him my birthday and my personality type. (It´s bookworm by the way)

![Jambette a green frog saysI didn´t mean to keep it for so long... Please, take it back to Cashmere before I get in trouble, croak-kay! ](/images/2023/Screenshot_2023-08-06-20-28-07-002_org.dolphinemu.dolphinemu.md.jpeg#center)


But as soon I was done with that and on my way to my house... The emulator crashed. And half of my progress that day got lost.

I booted game again and I got to meet one last local I missed. Resetti.

Yep grumpy Resetti, the hardass mole who will give you shit for forgetting to save (or in my case have the game crash on me). I can see why they eventually retired him, he must´ve been scary for kids.

![Ressetti the mole saying Hello. Um... allow me to introduce myself. The name´s Resetti. Mr. Resetti.](/images/2023/Screenshot_2023-08-06-21-50-11-489_org.dolphinemu.dolphinemu.md.jpeg#center)

He takes his job of protecting the Time Continum very seriously. Afterwards I found out I can enable savestates, And I´ll be using these often to safeguard myself from such incidents in the future.
