So the fireworks were launched, glasses were clinked and all to welcome the new year.

It is also a time of reflection, to look back on what we achieved or not. While Im still fermenting from the last night´s events (as of this writing) I would like to take some time and do a small yearly review of this blog.

So to start:

## This Year´s Online Achievements

- The Creation of this Blog

- Making my own [personal website](https://creaturefeature.neocities.org/)

- Participating on the [Blaugust event](https://aggronaut.com/2022/09/01/blaugust-2022-in-review/)

- Sending a submission to the Yesterweb´s [Trick-or-Trick event](https://yesterweb.org/trickortreat2022/).

## What I Want to Achieve This year

- Complete my full photography portfolio

- Blog more frequently

- Submit more photos items for sale on Redbubble (I´ve been neglecting it as of late)

- Finish the library section of my site with at least one article per section

- Edit and post the rest of my playthroughs on youtube

- May or may not change my blog´s layout

As a new blog, I learned to expect that it takes time to receive new visitors. Still, apparently, Gaming Emulation seems to be the most popular among my readers, and I might consider exploring these in more detail. Maybe I might check out that old Star Wars Galaxy Game, or make a post about my retrogaming shenanigans in the future.

## Most Viewed Photography

**[My Birdwatching Sea Adventure with 20 views](/blog/bird-sea-adventure)**

While I probably consider the [cat post](/blog/street-cat-photography) one of my best ones, I had fun doing this, when I visited the port on a warm day.

Taking photos of flying birds is still somewhat difficult feat for me, but I´m happy it worked. I also had the opportunity to see some cormorants up close.

That being said I wish I had written more about my photography (seriously its hard to pick out a good photo sometimes), I plan to rectify that this year.



## Games Played This Year

Not one of my productive gaming years, but still I got to play through some gems:

| Title | Completion | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mutazione | Completed | Chill and interesting if you´re into visual novels |
| Alba | Completed | Cute concept and educational |
| Costume Quest 2 | Completed | Nice to play on Halloween |
| Cozy Groove | In Progress | Cute Camping Game, Already Expanded the Tent into a cabin |
| Elder Scrolls Online | Endless | This one is definitely a keeper, I enjoyed the story and plan on playing as long as I can |
| A Summer in Mara | In Progress | Still trying to leave the island |
| Child of Light | In Progress | Reached the spider boss level |
| Gran Theft Auto Online | Abandoned | Quit due to toxic userbase |
| Disneyland Adventures | In Progress | Almost 80% Completed, loved exploring the park |
| Final Fantasy XIV | Endless | Still on lower levels, plan on picking it up again |
| Knockout City | Abandoned | Fun concept, played it for a month |
| Fall Guys | Abandoned | Played for a couple minutes, turns out its not my thing |

And that concludes this year in review. Making this blog has been an interesting experience, while some might say that traditional blogging is a dying form, I for one think it is still the best way for me to convey ideas and showcase my interests.

Not to mention I got to meet some [cool](https://aywren.com/) [people](https://www.gamerlady.blog/) in the [blogosphere](https://bhagpuss.blogspot.com/), some of which have since then become part of my blogroll or RSS feed, so a shoutout to those guys.

And as a final word, I would like to give a huge thank you to all the readers of this blog, It might not seems much but I do enjoy receiving every bit of feedback, and hope you all will stick around for next year.
