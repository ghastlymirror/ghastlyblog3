Itch.io has recently made an [announcement](https://itch.io/t/5149036/reindexing-adult-nsfw-content), they are now re-indexing free adult content with plans to do the same for paid in the future. That being said creators who don´t want to wait have the option to make their works free.

This is in my opinion a step in the right direction, but sadly, creators who do wish to still be compensated for their work will have to choose between that or making their stuff acessible again.

That being said  I would take this as a sign to to continue what we´ve been doing so far and not slow down, its very easy for movements to die down as they see the most bare results, so lets keep at it sicne we´re not out of the woods yet.

As the days pass by we are starting to see some results, to the point that Mastercard has finally released a [statement](https://archive.ph/IsoIc) which is and I quote:
> Mastercard has not evaluated any game or required restrictions of any activity on game creator sites and platforms, contrary to media reports and allegations.
Our payment network follows standards based on the rule of law. Put simply, we allow all lawful purchases on our network. At the same time, we require merchants to have appropriate controls to ensure Mastercard cards cannot be used for unlawful purchases, including illegal adult content.

Ok, there is a lot to unpack here. Its very obvious that this very milquestoast response shows that they are trying to deflecting any responsibility over this. I also have half a mind to call them right now and ask what sort of content that broke the law did they find on Steam that warranted this, like give me examples! Like just Name them! Oh wait, they mentioned they don´t even evaluate the games in question.

So, what are the standards then!? Are you just going off of vibes? Wanna bet there was nothing illegal being sold there, to the point they went against their own rules?

As for "We don´t require restrictions on game sites", Valve has finally [broken their silence](https://kotaku.com/mastercard-denies-pressuring-steam-to-censor-nsfw-games-2000614393), and confirmed that yes, that Mastercard did got involved but in a indirect manner, by communicating with payment processors and banks while never bothering to communicate with Valve.

A user named @trepeserafin on bluesky, has created a thread explaining this in bigger detail:

A possible explanation of what exactly happened between Steam, Internet Merchant Account, and Card Companies.

It&#x27;s really long, and I&#x27;m not used to BlueSky, but let me try to copy paste the content.<br><br><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:l3zvatao6tih4hpyun76qzgp/post/3lvebgrq3j22n?ref_src=embed">[image or embed]</a></p>&mdash; Trepe Serafin (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:l3zvatao6tih4hpyun76qzgp?ref_src=embed">@trepeserafin.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:l3zvatao6tih4hpyun76qzgp/post/3lvebgrq3j22n?ref_src=embed">August 1, 2025 at 7:23 PM</a></blockquote><script async src="https://embed.bsky.app/static/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


While Valve has been pressured into compliance, one gaming platform is fighting back. GOG has created an initative called [Freedom to Buy](https://items.gog.com/freedomtobuy/index.html) and is giving away 18+ games for free. So, if you wanna still get your adult gaming fix, go nuts, show nuts, whatever. To each their own I guess.

But I´m not Suprised that GOG of all places is doing this, after all, their main mission has been games preservation, either through allowing people to buy old games or making sure they are able to work in modern machines for the foreseeable future.

This been the updates so far, I was gonna make my first post celebrating Blaugust, but this takes priority. 

Until next time.
