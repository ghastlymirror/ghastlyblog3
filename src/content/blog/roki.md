So, last week I´ve been playing this interesting game called Roki. It had caught my interest for being based in Scandinavian folklore with creatures like trolls and other sorts of monsters, and since it´s one of my favorite topics I decided to take a look.  
So what are my thoughts on it?

## **A beautiful Fairytale...**

In this game, you play as a young girl called Tove who lives with her brother and Dad in a small cabin in the woods. But one day, strange things start to happen like a bird infestation not to mention a giant monster, the titular Roki destroys their home.  
At first, she and her brother Tomte managed to escape only for him to be kidnapped and now it´s up to her to rescue him.  
She then finds herself in the woods and meets several creatures, to complete her quest she must help and befriend them.  
I do not want to spoil the plot much as I feel this story is best experienced on its own, but it does some themes of dealing with loss and embracing the unknown.  
There is a mixture of family drama, some cute moments, and even some low scary ones as well

## **The Gameplay**

This is your typical point-and-click adventure game, you pick up objects, can look at them, and use them in a variety of inventory puzzles. Now the interesting part is that you can pick up objects to add to your journal. They don´t do anything but they are there for completionist players to find and you can even get a game badge if you find them all.  
I did enjoy this, It reminds me of whenever I would go on nature hikes I would just collect anything that caught my attention like feathers or cool-looking rocks, except there are fantastical creatures.

Now the puzzles are pretty straightforward where is only one clear answer, this means no wacky moon logic puzzles.  
You just gotta pay attention to your surroundings and speak to the characters. I barely even felt the need to touch the walkthrough.  
An example of puzzles you might expect to encounter can be things like boiling some tea, another might require you to create a mask to traverse an area. There is even a sliding puzzle.

## **Where the Wild Ones Are...**

As I previously mentioned most characters you´ll get to meet are from Scandinavian folklore, you have trolls, a type of gnome-like created called a Tomte, who will help on your quest.  
But not every monster is friendly, some like the Nokken can be downright scary and may require you to defeat them through puzzle solving. I´m not gonna lie that was one of the terrifying moments in the game, at first.  
While I´m not arachnophobic there is another moment involving confrontation with a giant spider where you need to use mirrors to chase it away. If spiders are something that can give you the creeps, keep that in mind.

As for the titular Roki, despite his more intimidating appearance, there is more to him than it meets the eye, as you play the game you will find more over his motivations and past.  
In fact, most of the creatures of the forest are indeed like that, with a story having a moral of not judging someone for their cover.  
Tove herself is indeed a sweet and brave protagonist who will do anything to protect her family and even befriends those that look different than her.

## **Art Direction**

I did love the very colorful settings, similar to a child´s storybook. You get to explore beautiful snowy landscapes and old ruins. There is even a church that is based on real Scandinavian churches.  
The characters including the Trolls have a cutesy design, although there are moments where some monsters have a scary appearance, like for example Roki and the main villain, looking something out of a dark fantasy. This is something I kinda enjoy, I do like that there is a bit of contrast between this whimsical story and also the darkness in it. This story after all deals with tragedy.

My favorite part is the navigation menu, you have a backpack icon for your items and you have a journal where it gives you all the necessary information.  
There's a section for maps, journal entries about different locations with new information being added as you play, a section where you keep your collectibles, and a place to showcase all your badges.  
It´s extremely helpful in reminding players what they should do next if they get lost.



## Game Rating

This is another must-play to my ever-growing list of adventure games. You have a simplistic but straightforward puzzle game with a beautiful setting and a fairytale-like structure.  
The game only takes about 10 hours to complete depending on how long you take to solve the puzzles plus spending the time exploring and finding collectibles.  
If this type of game is up your alley feel free to check it out.
