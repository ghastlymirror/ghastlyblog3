So, you may have noticed this blog has been inactive for a while now, for a couple of reasons.

One, for some reason I couldn´t get post to work here, so it made pretty much impossible for me to write anything, and for one I felt a bit uninspired.

If you haven´t followed me on other social media accounts here´s what i´ve been up to in these past months:

- I managed to upload a bunch of game play through and automatically schedule them

- Add an article review for the obscure Anime series [Nightwalker](https://creaturefeature.neocities.org/movies/nightwalker) on my website

- Also Add [Rss](https://creaturefeature.neocities.org/rss.xml) feed for said website

- Attempted to take drawbox lessons again

- Started adding more photos to my tumblr photography blog

- Got reallly into the Vampire Hunter D Novel series.

- Started getting into this Solo TTRPG thing

What do I plan to do with this blog? I dunno. I´ve been trying to get back into doing game reviews but it doesn´t feel inspired. maybe I´ve been going this the wrong way.

Perhaps I should do something else besides, hey here´s this fun game I found check it out. Maybe something about gushing about cool enemies, whatever I´m sure I´ll think of something.

Till then, don´t be suprised if i don´t update this blog as frequently as I used to. But don´t worry this blog isn´t dead! It´s just i got a lot of stuff going on in my life.
