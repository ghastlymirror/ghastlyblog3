## How Did I do This Month?

Ok so today its the last day of August, and thus ends Blaugust. Oh boy, I promised i was gonna blog more this month only to fail. I think I only wrote like 3 or 4 posts. I think maybe its because of writers block. That and I´ve been going out more and the rests has been mostly dedicated to me catching up to my favorite tvs and games. 

Of course to be fair that is more or less my typical blogging schedule, I only blog once a week or every two week depending on my mood. Coming up with stuff to write is hard. You would think that picking a specific topic would make things easier. But no. Specially I´m talking about something about the videogames i´ve been playing.

Because its not just mentioning what the gameplay is like, I gotta mention what I think of it, and what makes it enjoyable for me or not. And to believe there are people out there who do this for a living.

On a more positive side I did managed to find some new blog to add to my reading feed.

But I´m just writting this to complain, despite its hardships I still writting for my own website with my own words is still worth it. When I first started this foray in more traditional long form of blogging, I did it with a purpose. I was disapointed with the tumblr purge of 2018, which reminded me how little control I had over my own account, twitter became a mess and its short form was not a great way to convey complex ideas.
And wordpress.com? The less the say of it the better.

So I hunkered down to create a blog, and in the process? I even adquired some basic skills, I learned how to adquire and set up my own domain, I even learned how to use a static site generator of all things. Can you believe I was used to coding html by hand? Of course, I was using for my neocities website. I´m still unsure If I could ever convert it to Astro, though. My code is still a bit of a mess Then again that site is more experiemental. 

But so simply using it on a blog works fine.

Now that I´m done talking about my blogging porcess what exactly i been doing this last month?

## Game Emulation

I´ve been exploring emulation a bit more. This time on my phone. I am not strange to emulating other game systems, but I´ve always did it on a computer so its a different beast all together.

First thing I did was to create two folders, one for my roms and the the other for my save files. Then the second part was to download emulators. The ones I´m currently using are pizza boy A (gameboy advance), psspp (playstation portable), dolphin (wii and gamecube), duckstation (playstation 1) and of course azahar (3DS).

Then I ended up using a frontend called Daijisho to organize my game collection.

And for the game I had to be more selective, because my sd card has limited space and i´m also using it with my music collection. I also tried to look up games that were mobile friendly. What I mena by this is games where I could play for short bursts. To this i started off with gameboy advance and playstation portable.

Both were systems in their heyday that were designed exactly with portability in mind, and with the emulators having save states in made my job easier. Also I picked games that were quote, onquote touchscreen friendly. Which does limit a buit more what games I´m playing.

So, I´m sticking to stuff like rpgs, pinball or puzzles games. Stuck doesnt requerie reflexes. And i know what you might be thinking, why not get a controller for your phone?

Well I´m working on that, its just there´s a lot of options out and I´m to find one that is afordable, and also i gotta remember to bring the controller with me. Mind you, I´m merely trying to use a device that i already have on the pocket without much fanfare.

I could buy one of the many emulation handhelds that I´ve seen being sold out there, but again it would defeat the purposes of simply using something I already own, and with so many options I haven´t find a handheld that I think it would satisfy me. One day i mgiht take the leap and buy like a retorid or an arbernic device, that this will have to do.

And I know there are some retro purists out there who will say that emulations is not nearly as good as playing in the real thing. In some ways I get it, even thought I used a 3DS emulators and its decent enought, it didn´t last long because I still prefer to play those games on my actual 3DS.
Plus the pain of havingto use citrahold to synchornize my saves and having to remember to backthem up every time I wish to play on a device might not be worht it.

But for the rest? First I have to hunt a device, that only works or least in decent amount of condition, physical game copies and make sure I´m not overpaying for it. Because have you seen the state of the retro gaming market? It´s like they want to pay an arm and leg for it? Sure there are ways to buy retro without breaking the budget. 

But it requires a lot of time, effort, bit of luck, like coming across a second-hand game store, an antiques fair (I only found playstation 3 games in there no consoles though) and maybe someone who is just looking to get rid of their huge collection.

And even that, I know I´m gonna wanna mod it. Take the psp for example. I will have to at least buy an sd card adapter, do something with the battery, jailbreak the darn thing. While its not impossible, its still a lot of work in order to make this handheld perfect for modern use. rather than just play games on one that already works for me right from the start.

I should know, I modded a 3DS myself, and it was a device I already own and bought back it was still sold on retail stores. Will I something decided to get my hands on a playsation portable or a vita? Maybe, and I might make a project out of it.

Speaking of project, I might be considering doing the same thing to an old phone I have laying around, I´m think about installing a new android os on it first, maybe that could end up being my diy game handheld. And while I´m at it get one of those controllers that fits around your phone making it look even more like a proper handheld.

## Watching some Fun Shows 

This summer has been a great season for anime, two of the shows I´m watching have Dandandan and the Summer Hikaru died.

Watching Dandandan, I never had this much fun with a shonen anime in a while. I tried for example to get into demon slayer but it didn´t work out for me. But for some reason this one does.

I mean its a horror comedy, its got cryptids and monsters from traditional folkore, two of my biggest insterests, its got an actual romance plots that I cared about, well written and insteresting female characters, great animation, action and cool soundtrack.

And there is a lot of memorable stuff in there, I swear that whole exorcism scene where a j-rock band shows to help deal with a evil spirtis will always be seared in my brain.

As for the Summer Hikaru diead, its also a horror story, but a more slower paced one. You have this teenager who finds out his best friend died and was replaced by a supernatural being with the same memories. While that same being has to come with terms with having a body and even a sense of self for the first time. There is also some gay coded themes in this? Or maybe I´m reading too much into this.

I´m familiar with the manga though, and only managed to get into a few chapters. You never know what gonna happen next episode, what is this new Hikaru, and whats up with these ghosts?

There´s also the new season for Peacemaker, I´m kinda glad that James Gunn joined the DCU moviverse, he knows how to make fun and insteresting superhero stuff.


## Gaming


Even thought I´ve already made a small post talking about my summer gaming habits, I might as well give a few small updates.

I haven´t been playing Yokai Watch all that much, I´m planning on picking up again in September, probably gonna face a fox yokai. Still playing Powerwash Simulator.

For my more mobile gaming habits, I started playing Warioware for the gameboy advance. It at the last set of minigames, although its still a struggle. As well Sonic Pinball party,i didn´t even bother with the story mode because it almost seems impossible to beat so I´m sticking with arcade mode.

Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga is a bit different from the RPG´s I usually play, it´s cute and funny, also you team up with Bowser?

And speaking of RPGs I ended up playing the first Persona game. I know there are people who will swear to me up and down that you´re better off with playing Persona 3 or the later games. But I kinda really wanted to see how this series got its start.

Well its is something, Persona has yet to find it´s footing here, it´s a bit more linear and feels more like a tradional Shin Megami tensei game with extra steps. And there no social links or life sim elements.

tHat being said I´m playing the psp version which makes this translation closer to the original and added back the snow queen quest that was cute during its original western release. Also the new soundtrack is an absoulute banger made by the same folk who worked on the later games.

Gonna try and see it to the end at least, I just rescued new party members from prison and about to go into the abadoned factory to investigate.

Lastly, I´ve been playing Fusion Fall Retrobution, which is a fan revival on an old mmorpg made by cartoon network, that I used to pplay back in the day, I´m probably on writting my take of it, but it has been fun so far.


## Enjoying the rest of Summer

Ok, what was so worth it, that I negleted to make more posts for blaugust? Going to the beach mostly, althoguht I could say I haven´t been going there as much as the previous months due to some weather conditions. This week I gone at all, there this storm in the atlantic sea which lead to having to big ocean waves covering a huge chunk of the beach and even damaging beach bars.

The lifeguards where on high alert, since people could be accidently dragged in the water by the strenght of those waves, so no swimming for me. And when I did go there in the beach, besides going to the water, I would either read, playing soem mobiles games or play uno.

But I haven´t reading much this month as well, i tried reading this book called The Mystery of the Yellow Room written by same guy who wrote Pahntom of the Opera, and I just couldn´t finish it, I felt kinda bored? And I´m the type who likes old timey mystery novel like Sherlock Holmes.
