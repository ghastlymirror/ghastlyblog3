I make no secret about my disapointment on JK Rowling´s recent shenanigans which put a wrench in my interest in playing the latest game set in her Universe, Hogwarts legacy.

Still, the idea of a wizard/witch focused game and possibiliy going to a magic school does have legs so I went and dug up some current games that might scratch that itch, specially if anyone is looking for alternatives:

## 1.Skyrim: Winterhold College

One of the fun things of Skyrim is that it gives you completle freedom to just do whatever the hell you want. Be an assassin, get married and adventure with your spouse, become a vampire etc...

But somewhere in this region of Tamriel there is a very special college just for mages that players can attend! And located in the northern section of the city of Winterhold in northern Skyrim where players can hone their magic skills.

In order to apply, you need to pass a test which requires you to cast a spell, which should not be too hard. Once that´s done you´re free to enter the college and explore.

Similar to the Mages Guild in previous Elder Scrolls games, it comes with its own set of quests, there´s also trainers available for differen types of magic as well as a couple of lectures you can listen too.

I personally like to roleplay my dragonborn motivation as an aspiring mage apprentice who just trying to get to the Winterhold as their reason for ending up in skyrim only to get involved into the main plot agaisnt they´re own will.

I just wanna go to college goddamn it! I knew I should´ve stayed in [Cyrodiil](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Cyrodiil).

## 2.The Sims


![Two Sims a girl with pink hair and a pink dress casting magic spells with her wand at another guy with black hair with ripped jeans and a black shirt with stars](/images/2023/sims4mages.jpg)

Despite being best known for being a life simulator game, this series is no stranger to introducing expansion packs around supernatural gameplay.

The Sims 4 : Realm Of Magic, for example introduces a rpg-lite magic system, an entire magical realm to explore, making potions, cute familiars, complete with NPCs that can teach up to 4 schools of magic.

But if Sims 3 is more up to your speed, there is the Supernatural expansion which not only introduces withces but other supernatural states, like werewolves, zombies, vampires, genies and even fairies.

Aside for the typical casting spells and witches duels, witch Sims can use a flying broom to get around, perks of it being a more open world. And the world that it provides is kinda cozy.

Moving on to the older iterations of this series, Sims 2 has Apartment Life, of all expansions. You got flying broomsticks, familiars and book spells galore.

Although the hilarious part is that it has an alignment system, Bad Witch Sims have green skin similiar to the wizard of Oz, and good witches are sparkly.

Sims 1 has... Making Magic, which is pretty much what it says on the tin, and yes there is an entire magic town you can explore or create, I guess.

## 3.Magician´s Quest: Mysterious Times


![The game cover for Magician´s Quest showing a wizard surrounded by cute animal characters](/images/2023/magicquestds.jpg#medium)

Also known as Enchanted Folk and the School of Wizardry for the European DS Version, this is basically Animal Crossing with wizards.

No really, there´s a lot similar stuff in there, from the whole decorating your dorm room, catching bugs and fish, animal villagers etc...

The difference is that you´ll be playing a student of a wizarding school, you can go to classes, which serve as the game tutorial, and cast spells through the use of different symbols.

Ocassionally, there´s an event called Mysterious Time, where the sky turns red, you get to catch special bugs (and fish) and you´re given quests to solve.

But there is one thing that I think this game does better is the social system, you can actually cultivate rivalries and even date some of your classmates, you heard me right date. If you have high enough standing with a villager in praticular that might eventually ask you to be their boyfriend/girlfriend.

I also kinda like some of their designs, which isnt just limited to animals, but robots and there´s even talking phone?

This being an older DS game, you can either try to buy it second hand or just play it on an emulator.

## 4.Ikenfell


![Ikenfell cover shwoing a redhead girl](/images/2023/ikenfell.jpg)

This game has probably been talked about in other places but it still deserves a mention here.

Ikenfell is an isometric rpg with a magic school setting where the main character, a girl named Maritte is searching for her sister, and despite starting off with no powers, she finds out she has magic to and along with a group of friends goes ot investigate some mystrious happenings around campus.

The games has similar gameplay to another titles like Paper Mario, you gotta move you´re character across the battle board and attacks are timed. There´s also no random encounters and you can avoid enemies if you want to.

For more acessibility, there is also the option to turn off timed attacks, and these can get more complex over time.

## 5.Wylde Flowers


![A witch flying on a broom](/images/2023/wyldeflowers.jpg)

Harvest Moon/Stardew Valley but with a magical touch.

If you´re familiar with this genre you´re probably familiar with basic gameplay, there´s farming and gathering, exploring interacting with the towns people and exploration.

As Tara you decide to move in with your Grandma to help with the farm, only to discover she´s a witch and you´re invented to join the coven. That being said not everyone in the town is open-minded and therefore you must keep your powers a secret.

By day you are expected to hang out with the townfolk and by night you meet up with your fellow coven members, during this time you can cast spells and create potions.

Althought the fun part is trying to figure out which of the town members are part of the masked coven, and there is enough quests and a story to keep it entertaining for hours.

There is one major difference is that seasons require magic to change compared to other farming sims, but the good news is that it gives you the option of how long you want each season to be and allows to fufill all the quests at your pace.

## 7.Spellcaster University

What if instead of being a student, you were the headmaster of a prestgious magic school?

That is what you get in this management game, players will be expected to build facilities such as dorms, classrooms, and hire teachers etc..

The fun part is that you´re at complete liberty to run the school whichever you please, maybe you wish to train future adventurers or make a dark magic school. There´s even choosing the look of the school and even what creatures you want to populate it with.

That being said you manage the facilities through a deck system, different decks can acess acording to the type of magic taguht there.

Not to mention running a school is the least of your worries, you will be expected to protect it from hordes of monsters, and there´s a lot of multiple choice events which will force you to deal with different factions, from evil dark lords to obnoxious student councils.

Did I mention you can build your school in crazy enviroments such as on the back of a giant turtle?

## 8.Narrative Games

They all fall in the same kind of genre somewhat so I´d figure it would be best to put in a single entry

- [**Camp W**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/820510/Camp_W/): A simple but cute interactive fiction game, but instead of going to magic school, you´re going camping! There are collectibles, spells to unlock and choices to make. The cartoony style is definitely a bonus.

- [**Magical Diary:**](https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/15611/Magical_Diary_Collection/) A bit more complex than other games of the genre, there is dungeon crawling with puzzles, you also get to experience school life and try and see if you can snag yourself a sweetheart. I´m also fond of the anime style, which is definitely going on my backlog.

- [**Potionomics:**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1874490/Potionomics/) A deckbuilding shop simulator, where you sell potions. Has cute 3d graphics as well as a romance system.

- **[Stardander School for Witches](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1733050/Stardander_School_for_Witches/):** A turn-based RPG with interactive fiction elements. Delve into the mysteries of Stardander the best magic school in the world! You can also acquire familiars, brew potions, and more.

- **[Witch Life Story:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1427340/Witchy_Life_Story/)** You tend to a magical garden and Brew potions, plus a choice in 6 different potential love interests

## 9.Upcoming Games

I could not end this blog post without mentioning a few games in development that hopefully will make their debut soon:

- [**Kitori Academy:**](https://kitoriacademy.com/) this entry fits the best of all my previous mentions when it comes to a magic school game. With its cute art style, and open-world academic exploration while going to class, you can also decorate your dorm room and have your very magical cat to bond with.

- [**Witchbrook:**](https://www.witchbrook.com/) This one is for the stardew valley crowd, with the very same publisher. It has some of the things that players enjoyed in that game (gathering, having relantionships with the town people, cute pixel graphics.) all under a school withchy package

- [**Near-Mage:**](https://www.near-mage.com/) One for the adventure puzzle crowd. Created by the same folk who did Gibbious. This hilarious game will take players for a wild ride in a magical school located right in the heart of Transylvania, deals with a lot of the local folkore as well, if you´re into vampires that is.

- [**Songs of Glimmerwick:**](https://songsofglimmerwick.com/) Yet another academy RPG, where music is deeply associated with spell casting! I also love how it is illustrated more like a storybook. You also get a garden to take care of.

And this the one I managed to find about if anyone knows of any other games that fit this theme feel free to write about it on the comments.
