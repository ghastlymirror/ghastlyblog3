What happens if you mix the gameplay of Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing and the aesthetic of Breath of the Wild? This is The result.

I´ve been looking foward to this game for months, specially since it takes cues from several farming sims that have been showing up lately.

:::note
As of this writting the game is currently in open beta, thus it might come with some incomplete features or bugs

So when it opened to the public I had to try it out. When I first open up the game I got to create my character. It is kind refreshing that you are prompted to choose a body type instead of gender, as it allows the game to be somewhat inclusive of different gender indentities.

And there is a variety of hair styles and clothing, your limit is your imagination. But one complaint is that I still find the body types very limited you´re not allowed to create heavy set characters, or choose their height or how muscular, which something I´ve gotten used to playing other games.

After I gave my character a nickname and a full name, I was off, the game started with a small cutscene where my character was summoned from the void in some old temple.

I was then introduced to one of the Locals, the plot here is that long time ago, humans went extinct... until they started showing up again out of nowhere. And my character has no idea who he is, and there is a mystery here to be solved which will be furter expanded on throught quests.

After a couple introductions have been made and some quests, I got my very first plot of land and added a tent to serve as shelter until I get a proper house. Sadly you cannot interact with the house decor, you can´t even sit on the chair, this needs to be a feature.

At this point if you ever played a farming sim, the gameplay will be familiar. You can gather materials simply by foraging, mining, woodcuting, fishing, hunting, bug catching and gardening.

These are your basic farming skills and you the more you them the more you level up.

However, some of these skills are bit different compared to other games, for example in bug catching instead of a net you get smoke bombs that you throw at bugs to stun them and catch them before you run. Players hunt with a bow and arrow, some creatures can be killed in one hit, while deer-like creatures requires you to hit it once than chase it and hit it again, unless you´re using better ammo.

Fishing consists of you waiting to get a bite then with your mouse you start reeling in while trying to keep the fish inside the circle. It took me a while to get used to it.

Interesting enough there is no stamina bar in this game, so players can farm as much as they want. Instead there is a focus meter, which can speed up the leveling process. It can be filled of course by eating food you create through cooking, which bring me to gardening.

The game does indeed have a night and day cycle that last every half an hour or so, you simply add a plot (you can buy more at the store) and plant some seeds, and water every ingame day cycle. Certain fertilizers can help you increase production or descrease the need for water.

My advice is to build a seed collector when you can as this allows players to turn some of the crops into seeds for their next batch and it will save you some money.

Next we have crafting. When I played I received a free workshop table from which I was able to build other crafting station like saws and ovens that can used to create contrustion materails. It can be used to build furniture, storage and upgrades. And I certainly didnt waste my time decorating my humble tent with them. This is a leveling up type of skill.

You can also make money by selling any items on your bin box or at the shops, because you will need a lot of it specially if you want to expand bag space and save an extra trip to the farm.

Because believe me most of your game will be spent walking back and forth, there are no mounts in this game (yet) so your choices are to just run everywhere, use the stables for quick travel (it costs money), or climb the highest point you find and use your glider which is kinda fun.

Instant teleportation to your housing plot is also possible but it does come with an half an hour cooldown.

Thankfully the area isn´t too big, while some people would´ve prefer for the game world to be bigger, it´s a blesssing in disguise for the amount of running around you´re gonna do. So far, there are only two major areas the Killima and the Bahari Bay. With more to be added in future updates.

But the biggest glaring flaw, here is that you can´t swim, you just drown, and I´m like what kind of MMO doesn´t allow you to swim!? I want a word with the developers.

Once I got the lay of the land , I can now focus in socializing with the locals. The NPCs here function a bit different from other MMOs, they don´t just give you quests, you can actually create relantionships and even romance.

There about 8 love interests in total, sadly you cannot date the sexy miner with the muscles but you can date a robot. In fact you can date as many as you want at the same time. But you can only use the love pin in two characters. Provided your relationship level is high enough. (Higher levels also give you crafting recipes)

There are couple of ways of socializing, you either simply talk to them, complete their quests or offer them gifts. Mind you can only gift them once a day... in real time.

They also have a weekly want item, thankfully you have at least till Monday (again in real time) until it resets, the weekly items are all random, while regular gifts depends on that person´s tastes, like Hassian will accept furs but not plants for example.

And once you find their weekly item they will give you a special quest, which you can turn in for extra points and items.

Speaking of Quests, the main one involves solving the mystery of the humans, players will spending some time exploring ruins, and there are some basic puzzles to solve. You should able to get into find new areas as you progress to them. I´m still at the beginning so I haven´t much to say about it. Althought I do hear that the developers are planning on having a year-long arc.

![a screenshot showing the lot and its unlocked areas](/images/2023/paliahousinglayout.jpeg)

After doing all that I finally got my house (which by the way took seven real-time hours to finish after providing it with materials) At this point I am able to expand the plot size through writs. Which you can buy by using reputation points adquired through gameplay.

But I know what you´re wondering what about the multiplayer aspect? Well for one I have´t experienced much of it yet, but yes you can indeed create a party with other players and join a community (there is no search buttong for it though)

One thing I found out thanks to one helpful player pointing out to me, if both players are mining a node at the same time they both get access to materials without even being part of a group.

And if you´re missing materials for crafting you can request it from other players or fufill them yourself. And if you have a stove and a prep table you can find your friends to your home and cook together, I guess. You can also invite complete strangers there as well.

Not to mention everytime you enter the server or leave your home, you enter into a random instance that allows for up to 25 players to avoid it being overwhelmed. But friends can be summoned to enter the same instance.

As for the game´s appearance it´ has decent graphics, with its cute cartoony style. I did however have a friend mention to me that looks too much like Fortnite for his taste, so your milage may vary. Frankly I thought it reminded me of FreeRealms ( a now defunct MMO).

One last thing to note is how monetization works, so far, the game is free to play, in fact every feature in this game is free with only thing you are able to buy with real money is cosmetic items that have no impact on the gameplay. But I do feel it´s still a bit pricy for what they´re offering. I do hope they do have events where you can unlock some outfits.

That´s pretty much it for my review of this game, there is also several secrets you can find through exploration I´ll leave it as a suprise. Mind you there were some bugs during my playthrough, like the gifting menu being stuck, or a character walking without their animation. Not to mention the instability of online connections.

Take this this in mind, while you play. Hopefully they will have fix those issues by the time of its official launch.
