## Video Summary

All right, last part of the walkthrough. I finally got all the band back together.... Well almost all of them.

In a plot twist our main character finds himself in a Rock battle! The puzzles around are simple.

I used my knowledge of lyrics that I got so so far and try to complete them until defeating the bad guy, then the end credits just roll in.

If yall been following so far, thanks for watching and hope you sticks around for other playthroughs.
