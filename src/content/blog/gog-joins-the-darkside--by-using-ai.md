## The Alternatives
I know what yall thinking, what are my alternatives? Are we going to have to sail the seven seas just be able to truly own a game copy? And will I have to start to learn how to use programs like Dosbox just to make old ones work? 

Well, fear not there are some solutions. I´ve stumbled upon these two game stores: [zoom-platform](https://www.zoom-platform.com/) and [Fire Flower Games](https://fireflowergames.com/products?page=8) (whose focus is mostly on narrative driven games).

Both offer drm-free games, the number of available titles might be smaller but they make up for it in quality. (Duke Nukem´s Whole Collection Anyone?).

And at least zoom has made a clearer statement [about AI](https://www.zoom-platform.com/news/thoughts-on-ai), there´s that.

Moving on to other older workable games if there´s a title that you can´t find on these two stores there´s this interesting project called [exoDOS](https://www.retro-exo.com/exodos.html) made with the sole purpose of preserving and making DOS games playable with a cool front end and even acess to manuals. (I reccomend the lite version if you don´t have much space). 

But if if you it find too overwhelming and just to download an individual game, the [Collection Chamber](https://collectionchamber.blogspot.com/) has got you covered, of course its dedicate to abandoware games that have yet to be made available lofficially, with the caveat of ocansionally removing donwloadble links should they start being sold again.

For the indie loving crowd there is always itch.io. Now, I still have some msigivings of reccomending this one due to how they reacted to gaming censorship brought on by [payment processors](/blog/censorship-in-gaming-itchio-valve), but as it stands, it´s best we got on that front
