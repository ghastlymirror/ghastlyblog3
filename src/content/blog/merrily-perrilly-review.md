##  Mini-Review

Here is a small comedic little game I just found on itch.io.

The main objective of this game is to survive for as long as possible. You have to run all over the map to find solutions that will extend your life a little bit longer, but sometimes the solutions will end up hurting more than helping.

For example, ask a vampire for help in removing a leech? Well he bit you and now you´re bleeding.

Ask a fortune teller for help? Now you´re cursed.

This makes the gameplay a little bit of trial and error, which is part of the fun.

There is a dozen ways to die, each more wackier in the next, all done in a cutesy cartoonish style. Also some collectibles scattered around the map.

So far I only lasted for about five minutes as you can see in this video.

## Rating

I give it a 4 out of 5 for creativity
