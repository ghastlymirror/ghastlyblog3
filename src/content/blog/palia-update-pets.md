The irony of me making a [Palia review](/blog/palia-one-cozy-farming-mmo) and mention what is missing in the game only for shortly after having the servers down for maintenance and with it a brand new update!

:::note
At the time of this writting the game is currently in open beta, thus it might come with some incomplete features or bugs.
:::

Curently they just launched launched Patch 0.166 possibily the very first real proper patch for the game.

Going [throught the notes](https://palia.com/news/patch-166) there is some interesting stuff, you got stuff like new quests, exp balanced rates, new items for zenki machine, several quality of life updates etc.

The first big major one is story progression, previously the main story would end as soon as you finished "Find a Sepp" Quest, now you can continue the main plot starting out with an Aceptance Ceremony.

You also can start quests by finding specifiy items during your exploration.

But the biggest update out there, one that I think was probably the most requested by players is the introduction of pets! Hurray.

They do look cute, however the only way to get one is if you purchased premium currency for the cosmetic outfits. One of them can be obtained if you bought any ammount or if you purchased up to 3,000 Palia coins over the course of the game.

Sadly there isn´t any pets for the players who are still hesitant to invest in the game, but its a start. Hopefully they might give us an alternative way to adquire one. Maybe some cool event?

Also some good news for those with less powerful machines, you can now join in on the fun.

However one change might sorta divide the playerbase, harvestables will provide less materials, while certain nodes have also changed location. I guess they´ve been trying to make the game more balanced? Since I´ve gotten used to the abundance of resources and finally figured where to find them, looks like I\`m gonna have to adjust my playing stragegy.

The one silverlining is that you get more exp now everytime you gather.
