Most people are probably familiar with the game Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines or the tabletop version that I was based.

So here I am finding about another new entry in the series.

Now, i´m a huge fan of vampire games, if there´s a vampire in it you´ll be sure to get my goth claws on it: castlevania, bloodrayne, Elder Scrolls even the Sims.

And Vampire Masquerade alone, makes for an interesting universe to play with, considering its lore.

However before going in, the first thing to note that is a interactive novel instead of being a full on rpg, which is fine my me, as I´ve played this genre, but I know its not to everyone´s speed.

## Story

The plot ironically start off similar to bloodlines, you are a newly turned vampire as a result of an illegal embrace, and normally your kind would´ve been executed right away... if it weren´t thanks to the intervention of a charitable kindred offering to take you under her wing, and teaching you the ropes of being a vampire.

But in return you are expected to do a couple of tasks for her.

If you noticed the name, there´s a reason why its called Coteries of New York. In the VTMverse, a coterie is a group of vampires allied together to fulfill a common goal. It´s pretty much similar to a Dungeon´s and Dragons party.

And that is pretty much the main mission of the game, you are to go out to the city and try to recruit at least 2 characters for your coterie.

There´s about 4 avaible characters and well as a couple of optional side stories, one tip here, the plot only advances once you get at least complete 2 character stories (or fail), so be sure to try and complete the side ones first.

I made that mistake on my first playthrough, and left half of them complete .

## Gameplay

Speaking of playthroughts, when the game starts you get a pick on three pre-made character from different clans: Brujah (rebellious types with a focus on brute force), Ventrue (aristocratic vampires with a focus on power), and Toreador (Anne Rice style expies with a focus on seduction).

I was sad to learn that it was just these three, there was no opportuniy to play my favorite clans like Malkavian and Tremere, and the only customization you can get is just changing their name.

I think it was by design, and there is only so many ways to replay the game, each character does come with their own backstory, and there even a small arc where they have to deal with their former human life.

For my first section I picked Toreador and my Character was an artist and was forced to pretty much cut ties with his own sister. And you do get different dialog options according to the powers you have, which is a decent translation of the series RPG mechanics.

After I finished playing the opening scene, I was taught some of the basics throught the hunger system.

Vampires need to feed, and by skipping feeding too many times, you get every a reminder that your inner beast is taking over.

Which is all well and good, except feeding is not that simple, you can´t just click on a button, over the course of the chapter you will given a option to drink blood, and hope it ends well.

The issue thought, its that there is no way to know when it will happen or even if you will be given an oportunity to eat at all. Early in the game, you do get a mission to hunt. But once that is over you´re pretty much on your own.

Also they have a weird way of just showing up in middle of missions, do you focus on the main task at hand? Or do you take a sip when you´re supposed to be on the lookout for your partner.

To be fair its not too bad as in some situations feeding did help the mission (like bitting gives humans amnesia or something) but it still does feel risky at times.

Althought, at one point I did made my mentor disapointed in me for associating with an uncouth character simply because I took on her offer of free food, ha.

What are the consequences if you don´t eat? Some dialog options are closed off while other open up to make it a bit more immersive, but that it as you will.

I never stuck around to find out what happens if you do not eat but be my guest.

Once you get over it, I think the strength of this game relies on its storytelling. I did enjoy how well all these character were written. My favorite of the bunch was D'Angelo a nosferatu detective, trying to solve a string of murders, as well the Tremere chapter, where you help a vampire out with his research despite him being introverted.

There´s also a lot of plots of intrigue and politics for you to sink your teeth in. Can´t be a Vampire the Masquerade game without them.

The creators also made this game a lot more acessible for those who are new to this Universe, at different points in the game you unlock a new lore entry, so you get to know more about how this world works. Also the fact that you the player are also new to this world in canon does gives it ample reason for this sort of exposition.

## Missing the Mark

Despite this I do have some choice criticisms, for one I wish my choices actually did matter, there were a bit more consequences.

The worst you get if you pick the "wrong choice" is that a character might be mad at you, but will quickly move on with the story.

To give an example I´ve been trying to save a character and no matter what I picked I would fail with the only difference will be on how mad the Sheriff is at me.

There is also just one ending, which was kinda disapointinging, specially for a visual novel, because I´ve played similar games in the genre and what I did in the game had not impact on how it ended.

One silver lining is that the game encourages you to go through mutiple playthroughts in order get the full story, also achievements, and yes it is possible to actually die in the first 20 minutes, should you reject the offer to be saved, if you want to unlock that one first.

Of course, saving in this game is really weird, you only get three save files, no way to make mutiple saves at any point in the game, and once you finish, your save gets deleted.

This means you gotta replay the game right from the start instead of going back whenever you want to try a different path.

## Final Thoughts

I am a bit in a dillema on how to rate this game, on the one hand I liked several aspects of the story and art gives it an atmospheric feel.

On the other hand, the people behind made some really off choices that kinda detracts a bit from the experience.
