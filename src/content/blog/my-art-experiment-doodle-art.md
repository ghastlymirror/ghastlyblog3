During one day of boredom and being stuck at home for a while I decided to binge-watch a [couple of art tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opBiBfbwgzA) when I came across the concept of doodle art.

Being the type of person who spent years and years just doodling little drawing in my notebooks during classes and lectures, I decided to give it a try.

So the first thing I got was this 0.5 mm line art pen, not exactly the most expensive, but it will do for this project:

I also printed out a worksheet and tried to play with different patterns and even mixing them up together until I found the ones I liked.

Then I started working on the main drawing, first I drew a rectangle on the page which will serve as the boundary of the drawing Then bit by bit, I started to draw small patterns at first, slowly filling the page with doodles.

Took me about an hour or two but Ta-da! Here´s the final result:

I want to note that I didn´t exactly know how the final image was gonna end up. I was pretty much improvising at this point, going with the flow. I guess this is one type of art where you don´t have to overthink.

All and all it has been a very interesting experience for me, I might try it again.
