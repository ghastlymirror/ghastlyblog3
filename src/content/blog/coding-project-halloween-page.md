Greetings to all you ghosts, ghouls and goblins out there. It is the start of October, the scariest month of the year.

I´m sure some of you had a headstart on decorating your house and prepare (those that live in places that celebrate it that is)

As for me I don´t have such an option, so I did the next best thing, decorate my [second home on the web.](https://creaturefeature.neocities.org/)

I was also inspired by the goods folks behind [the yesterweb](https://yesterweb.org/), this year they are organizing a [Halloween websurfer](https://yesterweb.org/trickortreat2022/) which allows users to visit a bunch of sites around this holiday.

For those who don´t know, the yesterweb is an online community about rediscovering both the old web and making the internet fun again in a time where online spaces are getting more corporatized and social media based.

I just submitted mine, so fingers crossed that it gets accepted.


But in the meantime, what can you expect going in?

:::tip[Update]
The Yesterweb Community is no longer as active as it once was, its forum and Discord server have been shut down with only the site and mastodon instance remaining. Most of its members have since moved on to other projects and communities like the [32.bitcafe](https://32bit.cafe/), [Neonet Server](https://discord.gg/3ZM9SyKu8Z), the [Melonland Forum](https://forum.melonland.net/) or [Fandom Coders](https://www.fancoders.com/)

I myself left the community shortly before the shutdown with my own reasons, mostly to being unhappy with how the moderators handled things, but I´m leaving the links here for archival purposes 
:::

If you [click around,](https://creaturefeature.neocities.org/misc/halloween.html) you might have a couple of special pages and goodies you can take with you to decorate your site/blog, among other things. I won´t tell.

I also took some inspiration from old websites back in the day.

See, back in the day people would go out of their way to create virtual haunted houses you could explore, or even halloween theme pages full of information and graphics you could collect.[^1]



![a black and red website with picture of skulls that says frightbytes](/images/2022/frightbytes.jpg)



The haunted houses[^2] were my favorite though, you would navigate from page to page by clicking on door or other interactive elements that would take to a different room full of scary monsters and ghosts.

Some would even go as far to reward you with a fun little graphic as a prize for participation,[^3] the more creative ones had a scavenger hunt.

It was in the spirit of those old pages I grew up with that I figured what I wanted do and also armed with some Halloween graphics that I started to work on it.

But hey if you´re thinking about making one of your own here´s my personal Virtual Trick or Treat Guide:

## Halloween Page Recipe

1. A free static hosting site [like Neocities for example.](https://neocities.org/)

3. [A good HTML tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/)

5. (Optional) A site layout template, life for example from [Sadgrl](https://goblin-heart.net/sadgrl/projects/layout-builder/) or [Eggramen](https://eggramen.neocities.org/code/css_testpages.html)

7. Plenty of Halloween Graphics! Sites like the [Gif Necromicon](https://horrorgifs.neocities.org/), [Fairytrash](https://fairytrash.neocities.org/halloween/goodies.html) and [Gifcities](https://gifcities.org/), [Linda´s Haunted Halloween](https://web.archive.org/web/20230604213250/http://www.lindashauntedhalloween.us/) should satisfy your needs

9. [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) to code your pages

11. For static images the [PngTree](https://pngtree.com/) or [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/pt-br/).

13. (Optional) Free editing software like [photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) and [removebg](https://www.remove.bg/upload), [compresspng](https://compresspng.com/) if you wanna make your own images or edit current ones.

15. (Optional) Images Hosting sites like [imgur](https://imgur.com/), [imgBB](https://imgbb.com/) or [Catbox](https://catbox.moe/), if you don´t wanna host them directly

17. Share your Website! Post a link to it on your blog, with your friends etc... Some index sites like [Wibby](https://wiby.me/) will even let you submit pages if it fulfills the requirements, webrings like the [yesterweb ring](https://yesterweb.org/webring/), [site listings](https://districts.neocities.org/), [searchmysite](https://searchmysite.net/), [fanlists](http://10-31.net/halloween/) just to name a few.


And there you have it, hope you´ll find this fun as I did. And if you do decide to make your own project be sure to comment it, I might even feature some of it on there!
