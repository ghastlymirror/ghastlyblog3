After I made my first photography blog post I realized I yet to have posted terms and conditions for the use of my images.

And since I took some effort in making them and not everyone is aware of the ethics of using photos from other blogs or sites, I decided to write my own terms if I´m gonna showcase my own here

Terms and conditions can be found in the Site Terms section, and I would appreciate it people would read it closely before taking those images.

And who knows I might write small guide how to use images respecting the rights of other photographers in the future, since this is a topic I feel strongly about.

If you have any questions please feel free to comment below or contact me.
