![Steam Replay 2025 Review Your Year on Steam](/images/blog/steamreplay2025.jpg)


We´re now at the start of 2026, so its time for my annual gaming review! Like in 2024, most of my play time was spent outside of steam, with the focus being mostly on retro games, outside of that, adventure puzzle games I guess.

So starting with Steam first...

## Steam Replay

![Ghastlymirror´s 2025 Steam Replay stating 13 games played, 43 achievements, 73 sessions, 9 new games. Below is the section with Most played games, it says, Slay the spire 40%, Bugaboo Pocket 29%, Lord of the rings Online 9%, Flash Doll 6%, 100% Orange Juice 5% ](/images/2026/steamreplay2025.png#medium)

Looking at my [stats for 2025](https://s.team/y25/ftttnvq?l=english), my three most played games have been Slay the Spire, Bugaboo Pocket, and Lotr Online.

The first one has been in backlog for while, its something I´ve been casually playing between breaks considering the fact that is a rogue card game. I´ve yet to go past chapter 3. But it doesnt require a lot of investment, being easy to learn which has been my preference this past year.

Bugaboo also fits the bill as a casual game and the only one of two newly released games I decided to buy this year, seeing as that I usually go for older titles (Plus I had a big of enough backlog already). I picked this up because it scratched that virtual pet itch.

Now, Lord of the Rings... I guess my heart wasn´t simply in it as it was last year, and I was still stuck in the Shire! I dunno, I guess I just don´t have it in me to get really invested in MMOs. I´ve been trying to see if I will ever get the spark back.

It didn´t help manners that the game felt empty with only seeing the ocansionaly player here and there, maybe I need to go to a more populated server?

Silverlining I´ve gotten more Steam achievements compared to last year. With Bugaboo up to fully completion.

Lastly looking at the timeline, I almost forgot  about webfishing. Now this one saddends me, I went in there with high hopes.

A fishing game with a social chat aspect remiding me of those social mmos of old withan animal crossing aesthetic, I even fooled around with a bunch of my discord buddies.

Don´t get me wrong it was fun at first, and had some funny interactions with strangers online.. But eventually I got bored, I guess there wasn´t a whole lot to do. 

I was expecting that there would be at least seasonal events or something, but none of that ever came to fruition. To make it even more tragic, the game has since been abandoned by its own creator, not by choice mind you, but due to online harrassment and getting doxxed.

And that there have been problems in the servers due to moderation, trolls and hackers just taking advantage of the chaos.

It seems there are people who justdon´t know how to behave and due to that we may have lost what seems like an unique and wholesome online space.

I don´t know all the details but it seems like a bummer to me.

Sad news aside, it seems December is where I had a bit more variety, then again it was the holidays so i have a bit more time on my hands.

## Retro

Outside of more official stores, my preference both these past two years has been towards retro gaming (does the 3DS now count as retro gaming? I always thought only games till the 2000s era count, oh well).

Porbably due to emulators being available on android, which were a life saver for me. Whenever I had to be out of the house, on a road trip, waitng for a meal at a restaurant I´ve manage to snuck a couple of minutes of gaming.

But after learning that you got all these new handhelds coming out that have been made with emulation in mind lately, I´m tempted to get one of those myself. Maybe one day.

So my replay would be like this:

**Top 3 Games:**
- Yokai Watch
- Pokemon Pinball
- Persona 1

**Completed Games:**
- Piglet´s Big Game
- Rhapsody: A musical Adventure
- Witches & Vampires: Secrets of Ashbury

**Games with the Most Retroachivements:**
- Sonic Pinball Party
- Piglet´s Big Game
- Warioware Inc

 **Just Started:**
- Medievil

Again like with Steam, the pattern here was me sticking to more casual games, specially since I could pick them up for a couple of minutes. Going by the number of hours I put into Pinball games.

Now rpgs are a whole different story, I would be suprised if I even finish them this year, they seem more like once or twice a week affair if we´re talking about Yokai watch or something I play more sporadically like Persona 1.

 I´m confident I might actually get around finishing Yokai Watch perhaps sometime on the last stretch of 2026 or a bit later. Although, I seem to be stuck on a certain part ingame in Persona, as in I just fought the first boss, what now?

Rhapsody was a pleasant suprise, a musical in RPG form? Mind you the version I played was the ds version, I ended finding out they made ports of the series to the pc, so I might try to get a crack at it.

To save the best for last, we´ve got Piglet´s Big Game, which I guess it did justice for its reputation, as far Spooky Games for Kids go. I did play this one along with a family member. Mostly because we were both curious to see how deep the rabbit hole goes, and tunrs out some of the original voices actor from the movies and shows from this ear were on it.

## Non-Steam PC Games

![A game poster with a green beetle flying with the name Bugaboo Pocket](/images/2025/bugaboopocket.png#center)

As I mentioned the bulk of most of my playtime (not including old consoles games), has been done mostly outside of Steam, in between itch.io bundles, weekly epic games giveaway, flocking to Drm free Gog games, virtual machine windows abandonware and other grey areas, I decided to organize this list togethers as it follows.

**Top Played Games:**
- Vampire Survivors
- Gibbious: A Cthullhu Adventure
- Voodoo Detective
- Loop Hero

**Completed Games:**
- Home Safety Hotline
- Gibbious
- Voodoo Detective
- The Darkside Detective

**Just Started:**
- Cat Lady
- Hollywood Monsters

Just to discuss this list, Vampire Survivors doens´t need much explanation. I´ve found quite addicting, well a little to addicting for my own good, for what is a reverse bullet hell game.

Managed to get up to the bonezone level, but I haven´t figured out how to destroy that godamn skeleton ball! As for my the last two both were point and click games with interesting premises

One parodies lovecraft´s stories and was made by Transylvanians (to the point was part of the game is even set in their homeland playing homage to their own culture to boot), and another is a Detective story that shows a more positive representation of voodoo as a spiritual practive different from how its stereotypically portrayed in most media, along with themes about cultural exploitation.

Those stories alone were enough to keep my insterest, and as puzzles go they weren´t so convoluted that i didn´t know what to do as long I paid attention. I think they a decent way to introduce beginners to the genre.

The same I could not say for Hollywood Monsters, remaining stuck with some rope puzzle, I guess I will have to consult one of those [game hint sites](https://www.nicegamehints.com/) just to get somewhere. Yeah, yeah, I know it defeats the point of puzzle games, but I kind want to see how the rest of the story goes.

Home Safety was the only non-adventure puzzle game in this one, but a simulator with a supernatural twist, but I already made a previous article about it that you click on the previous post  link below see what I thought of it.


## That´s it for now

What do I plan on doing with my backlog, probably start playing more of the Steam games I have on the backburner, which I already started the year with Yakuza Kiwami.

I woudl wanna try and see If can finish Grim Fandango and Ikenfell as I seem to have taken a break for year while I did other stuff. So, who knows what 2026 will bring.

As when it comes to this blog I plan on finishing uploading the rest of my wordpress posts, I also I´ve been neglecting the photography section for a while, so keep a eye out for new posts in this category over the months.

 Happy New Year!
