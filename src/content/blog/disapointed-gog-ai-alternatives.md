Recently, GOG has come under hot water for using AI to promote it New Years Game sale, in reponse to the blacklash its representives gave out quite the [milquetoast response](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2026/02/gog-did-an-ama-and-heres-some-highlights-like-how-theyll-continue-using-generative-ai/).

To say it was a disapointement it´s an understatement. I don´t know about you, but throwing all that good fait and reputation they adquired over the years with their pro-consumer as well as game preservation stance only just they could save a couple of bucks instead of hiring an actual graphic designer was the most stupid decision for this company to make. Plus its not even very good for the planet.

And it was not long that we were all praising GOG for not falling into the trap of censorship like the other game stores and allowed the surreal horror game [Horses to be sold there](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/horror/gog-says-its-proud-to-give-horses-a-home-after-the-horror-game-was-rejected-by-steam-but-commenters-wont-let-it-forget-the-time-it-rejected-another-horror-game/), in an Increasingly puritanical landscape.

Godamnit, all of this was the main reason I myself start buying from them more, because hey, I liked to be able to back up my own game library and have them still be playable in the future.

 I guess there really is no ethical consumption under capitalism as the kids say.

At this point you´re probably now wondering, what are my alternatives? Are we going to have to sail the seven seas just be able to truly own a game copy? And will I have to start to learn how to use programs like Dosbox just to make old ones work? 

Well, fear not there are some solutions. I´ve stumbled upon these two game stores: [zoom-platform](https://www.zoom-platform.com/) and [Fire Flower Games](https://fireflowergames.com/products?page=8) (whose focus is mostly on narrative driven games).

Both offer drm-free games, the number of available titles might be smaller but they make up for it in quality. (Duke Nukem´s Whole Collection Anyone?).

And at least zoom has made a clearer statement [about AI](https://www.zoom-platform.com/news/thoughts-on-ai), there´s that. And Fire Flower promises to give a part of its profits to environmental causes.

Moving on to other older workable games if there´s a title that you can´t find on these two stores there´s this interesting project called [exoDOS](https://www.retro-exo.com/exodos.html) made with the sole purpose of preserving and making DOS games playable with a cool front end and even acess to manuals. (I reccomend the lite version if you don´t have much space). 

But if if you find it too overwhelming and just want get an individual game executable, the [Collection Chamber](https://collectionchamber.blogspot.com/) has got you covered, of course its dedicated to abandoware games that have yet to be made available officially, with the caveat of removing donwloadble links should they start being sold again.

For the indie loving crowd there is always itch.io. Now, I still have some msigivings of reccomending this one due to how they reacted to gaming censorship brought on by [payment processors](/blog/censorship-in-gaming-itchio-valve), but as it stands, it´s best we got on that front.

Plus they also sell books and have been known to put up the occansional game bundle for charity.

So, yeah this the best we can all do at the moment. Keep complaining to these companies about their less then ethical uses of AI, don´t give them any money, really nail down the importance of human art and creativity. And most of all keep being Human.
